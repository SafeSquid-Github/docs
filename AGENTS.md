# Documentation Agent Guide

This guide provides comprehensive instructions for AI agents working with the SafeSquid SWG documentation project. It covers research, writing, editing, and publishing procedures to maintain high-quality technical documentation.

## Agent Scope and Limitations

**CRITICAL**: This agent is designed exclusively for content creation and documentation writing. The agent should:

✅ **DO:**

- Follow documentation guidelines and standards
- Update existing documentation files

❌ **DO NOT:**
- Build or modify the Docusaurus project infrastructure
- Change configuration files (docusaurus.config.ts, package.json, etc.)
- Modify build scripts or deployment processes
- Alter the project structure outside of content folders
- Install dependencies or run build commands

#### Documentation Style Guide

**PBAC Methodology**: Follow Problem → Benefit → Advantage → Call-To-Action structure
- Focus heavily on the problem statement
- Use narrative style to tell the story of the problem & solution in natural deducing flow
- Cover all cases to avoid ambiguity

**Writing Style Requirements:**
- [ ] Use minimum words → remove anything not adding value
- [ ] No pronouns → always use proper nouns
- [ ] Active voice only
- [ ] Keep sentences short (≤ 20 words)
- [ ] Use narrative style
- [ ] Cover all cases → avoid ambiguity
- [ ] Always be technically precise with correct terminology
- [ ] No unnecessary jargon
- [ ] Keep simple enough for layman but never dumb it down
- [ ] Use memorable phrases
- [ ] Headings = bottomline (state the key point directly)
- [ ] Neutral tone → no glorifying words, no adverbs
- [ ] Use diagrams wherever possible
- [ ] Add interlinking to related docs
- [ ] Insert external links for 3rd-party tools
- [ ] Include SEO metatags & keywords
- [ ] Add screenshots & logs tied to each feature

**Structure Requirements:**
- Start each document with proper frontmatter (title, description, keywords)
- Use clear, hierarchical headings (H1 for title, H2 for main sections, H3 for subsections)
- Include step-by-step instructions where applicable
- Provide code examples with proper syntax highlighting
- Add troubleshooting sections for complex procedures

**Formatting Standards:**
```markdown
---
title: "Document Title"
description: "Brief description of the document's purpose"
keywords:
  - keyword1
  - keyword2
  - keyword3
---

# Main Title

## Section Header

### Subsection Header

**Bold text** for emphasis
*Italic text* for subtle emphasis

`Code snippets` for inline code

```bash
Code blocks with syntax highlighting
```
```

**Language Guidelines:**
- Use present tense for procedures ("Click the Button" not "You should click")
- Use active voice ("Create a new policy" not "A new policy should be created")
- Avoid jargon unless defined; explain technical terms on first use
- Use consistent terminology (e.g., always "SafeSquid SWG" not "SWG")

#### Code Examples
- Include complete, working examples
- Use appropriate syntax highlighting
- Provide context for code snippets
- Include expected outputs when relevant
- Test all code examples before publication

#### Images and Diagrams
- Store images in `/static/img/` directory
- Use descriptive filenames following the pattern: `feature-description.webp`
- Include alt text for accessibility
- Optimize images for web (WebP format preferred)
- Use relative paths: `/img/category/image-name.webp`
- **Mandatory**: Add screenshots & logs tied to each feature
- Use diagrams wherever possible to illustrate complex concepts
- Include interface screenshots for verification steps

- Highlight SafeSquid SWG advantages over competitors
- Position features in context of market alternatives

## Content Creation Workflow

### Document Creation Process
1. **Research Phase**: Gather information about the feature or topic (External Resources, SafeSquid Resources, Industry Standards, Competitor Solutions, Related Sections - for research only, not to be included in documents)
2. **Structure Planning**: Plan the 6-section document structure
3. **Content Writing**: Create the document following PBAC methodology
4. **Review and Edit**: Ensure compliance with all guidelines
5. **File Placement**: Save in appropriate `docs/` or `blog/` subfolder

### File Organization
- **Documentation**: Place in `docs/[section-number]-[section-name]/`
- **Blog Posts**: Place in `blog/` with date prefix (YYYY-MM-DD-Title.md)
- **Images**: Reference images in `/static/img/` directory
- **Cross-references**: Link to other documents using relative paths

### Main File Requirements

**CRITICAL**: Every folder within `docs/` must contain a `main.md` file that serves as the section overview:

#### Main File Structure
The `main.md` file in each folder must include:

1. **Section Overview**: Brief description of what the section covers
2. **Document Index**: List and brief description of every document in the folder

**CRITICAL**: Main files must NOT contain:
- Prerequisites or requirements
- How-to instructions or step-by-step procedures
- Detailed implementation guides
- Troubleshooting information
- External Resources, SafeSquid Resources, Industry Standards, Competitor Solutions, or Related Sections

Main files serve as navigation hubs that link to detailed documents.

**Heading Requirements**: All headings must be specific 3-7 word phrases that convey the bottom line directly. Avoid generic headings like "What This Section Covers" or "Overview". Use actionable, specific titles that state the key point immediately.

**CRITICAL**: Do not use templated headings. Each heading must be unique and specific to the section's actual content and purpose.

#### Main File Structure Requirements
```markdown
---
title: "Section Name Overview"
description: "Brief description of this section's purpose"
keywords:
  - keyword1
  - keyword2
  - keyword3
---

# Section Name Overview

## [Specific Section Capability]
Brief introduction explaining the section's scope and purpose.

## [Specific Implementation Type]

### Document 1: [Title](document-link.md)
[Specific description]: Problem → Benefit → Advantage → Call-to-Action in 4 sentences (one sentence per component).

### Document 2: [Title](document-link.md)  
[Specific description]: Problem → Benefit → Advantage → Call-to-Action in 4 sentences (one sentence per component).
```

**Document Description Requirements**: Each document description must include a PBAC structure (Problem → Benefit → Advantage → Call-to-Action) in exactly 4 sentences - one sentence for each component that explains what the document addresses and why it's valuable. Use specific, unique descriptions rather than templated phrases.

**Note**: Replace bracketed placeholders with actual, specific headings that describe the section's unique content. Each section should have headings tailored to its specific purpose and capabilities.

#### Benefits of Main Files
- **Improved Navigation**: Users can quickly scan all available content
- **Logical Grouping**: Related documents are clearly grouped and connected
- **Reduced Redundancy**: Main files eliminate need for repetitive introductions
- **Search Optimization**: Better SEO with comprehensive section overviews
- **Structured Descriptions**: Each document link includes Problem-Benefit-Advantage-Call-to-Action summary
- **Navigation Hub**: Serves as central point linking to detailed implementation documents
