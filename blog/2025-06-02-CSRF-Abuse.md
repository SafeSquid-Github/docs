## Legacy Defences: Ship Now, Secure Later

Modern web apps ship faster than security reviews can keep pace. Free JavaScript libraries come and go; developers copy snippets, unaware they inherit unvetted attack surface. **Cross‑Site Scripting (XSS)** still ranks in the OWASP Top 10, and when an attacker combines XSS with **Cross‑Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**, they can weaponise the victim’s own browser to execute privileged actions—no credentials required.

Pressure to release new features drives teams to adopt “good‑enough” escape‑html helpers or CSP headers and call it a day. Yet libraries age, input filters miss polyglot payloads, and security debt accumulates. XSS sneaks in; CSRF exploits the trust browsers place in first‑party cookies and passwords already present in the session.

> *Definition – XSS‑Driven CSRF*: An attack where a malicious script injected via XSS automatically issues authenticated requests (GET, POST, PUT) to the target domain, bypassing user intent checks.

## Anatomy of an XSS‑CSRF Chain

### 1 Reconnaissance: Mapping the Surface

The attacker scans customer‑facing apps—signup forms, search bars, comment boxes—for reflections and API endpoints lacking *SameSite* cookie flags. BankEase’s “Update Profile” page is a jackpot: the phone‑number field trusts the `Referer`header alone.

### 2 Payload Crafting: Polyglot by Design

Using mutation techniques—**XSS Polyglots**, double URL‑encoding, and DOM clobbering—the attacker creates a payload that sails past simplistic sanitisers. Example (URL‑encoded):

```
<img src=x onerror=document.body.append((new Image()).src='/profile/update?phone=+911234567890')>
```

### 3 Injection: Planting the Trojan Comment

The payload is posted in a public “Contact Us” thread. Because the field strips `<script>` tags but not event handlers in images, the attack nests safely.

### 4 Victim Engagement: Trust Exploited

A logged‑in BankEase customer views the thread. The browser parses the HTML, triggers `onerror`, and the hidden image fires a **POST** request that changes the account phone number—complete with session cookies—no click needed.

### 5 Stealth Persistence: Hijack & Harvest

With the phone number changed, the attacker initiates a password reset, intercepts the OTP, and takes over the account. They can now schedule fund transfers or add rogue payees.

### 6 Clean‑Up: Logs but No Alerts

Server logs show a valid session performed the change. Without CSRF token validation or origin enforcement, incident responders see no anomaly.

## Collateral Impact & Risk

XSS‑driven CSRF erodes the **integrity** of user actions—money moved, data altered, settings flipped—while leaving almost no forensic trace. Regulatory fines and customer attrition follow once fraudulent transactions surface.

## SafeSquid’s Cross‑Site Protection Measures

SafeSquid embeds a runtime shield into every HTTP response:

- **Auto‑Token Injection** – Adds unpredictable, per‑session CSRF tokens to all `<form>` and AJAX endpoints; mismatched requests are denied server‑side.

- **Origin & Referer Enforcement** – Blocks cross‑origin `fetch`, `XMLHttpRequest`, and image beacons unless whitelisted.

- **Event‑Listener Sanitisation** – Strips risky inline handlers (`onerror`, `onclick`) from user‑supplied markup, shutting down payload vectors.

- **SameSite & Secure Cookies** – Rewrites `Set‑Cookie` headers to `SameSite=Strict; Secure`, preventing automatic credential sends to third‑party origins.

- **Polyglot Detection Engine** – Decodes double‑encoded and mixed‑context payloads, catching mutation‑based bypasses in real time.

- **Instant Telemetry** – Any blocked cross‑site attempt triggers a SIEM alert with payload snippet and user context for rapid triage.

Users continue to interact with comments, previews, and rich content, but unauthorised state‑changing requests never leave the browser.

## Conclusion

Feature velocity needn’t equal vulnerability velocity. By intercepting unauthorised cross‑site requests and hardening session boundaries, SafeSquid buys development teams time to fix the root XSS while keeping customer accounts safe.
