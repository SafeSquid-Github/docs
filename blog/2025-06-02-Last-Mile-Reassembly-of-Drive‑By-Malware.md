## Legacy Defences: Scan the File, Miss the Puzzle

Today, the Malware as a Service (MaaS) ecosystem has democratised access to catastrophic cyberattack capabilities for a very affordable monthly subscription. Attackers can now rent zero-day exploits on dark-web marketplaces.

Traditional perimeter defences-anti-virus proxies, ICAP connectors, next-gen firewalls-evaluate **whole files** before they reach the endpoint. If the file hash is unknown, a sandbox detonates the sample; if the MIME type is suspicious, the download is blocked. Unfortunately, drive-by malware splits the executable into chunks that masquerade as CSS sprites, WebP images, or innocuous JSON. No single fragment violates policy, so the download gate opens.

**Client-Side Reassembly** is the attacker's force multiplier: WebAssembly glues pieces together in memory, decrypts them with a hard-coded key, and drops the final payload via the browser's FileSystem or Service Worker APIs. By the time EDR sees the binary, it is already executing under user context.

## Anatomy of a Malware Infiltration

### 1 Reconnaissance: Subscription-Grade Exploits

Dark-web MaaS shops (e.g., **RAMP** or **Exploit-in**) sell monthly access to browser exploit kits targeting Chrome zero-days. The attacker selects exploits compatible with the victim's tech stack and purchase tier.

### 2 Payload Obfuscation: Shred & Encrypt

The binary ransomware is XOR-split into 8 KB chunks, base64-wrapped, and served from disparate URLs: an SVG sprite sheet, a fake `update.json`, and a seemingly random PNG. Each part alone is inert; combined they reconstruct the PE file.

### 3 Zero-Hour Hosting: Fresh Yet Trustworthy

Attackers leverage cloud fronts-GitHub Pages, Azure Blob, S3 buckets-created minutes earlier. Because the domain is tied to a trusted provider and newly registered only at the sub-domain level, URL filters seldom block access.

### 4 Drive-By Trigger: One Visit, Many Requests

When the victim visits a compromised blog or malicious ad, an inline `<script>` calls each fragment. Content-Security-Policy bypasses are achieved via `data:` URIs or downgraded `blob:` links.

### 5 Last-Mile Reassembly: Assemble & Drop

A client-side loader gathers fragments, decrypts them, verifies CRC, concatenates, and writes `invoice_view.exe` to the user's Downloads folder-or spins up a PowerShell `Add-Content` pipeline. Endpoint AV sees only an approved process writing a new file.

### 6 Execution & Expansion: Chaos in Motion

The payload runs, encrypts mapped drives, destroys VSS shadow copies, and exfiltrates data to a TOR relay. If ransom is unpaid, data is auctioned on a leak site.

### 7 Burn & Recycle: Disposable Infrastructure

As telemetry catches up, the attacker tears down the blob storage and spins up new containers, ensuring indicators of compromise age out quickly.

## Collateral Impact & Risk

Drive-by infections cost more than ransom: they trigger regulatory fines, SLA breaches, and loss of IP. The median downtime after a successful browser-based ransomware drop in 2024 was **6 days** (Coveware Q4 2024).

## SafeSquid's Anti-Malware Measures

SafeSquid shifts inspection from *file arrival* to *file assembly*.

- **Fragment Inspection** - Every response, be it CSS, JSON, or image, is scanned for encrypted opcode patterns and suspicious entropy.

- **Assembly Watchdog** - A browser-helper ruleset blocks JavaScript attempts to `concat`, `atob`, or `WebAssembly.instantiate` untrusted blobs unless the host is on a *Trusted-Assemble* list.

- **Inline Sandboxing** - Suspicious fragment sets are reconstructed in a headless sandbox; if the hash matches malware families or behaves maliciously, delivery is halted.

- **Violation Telemetry** - Blocked assembly events are streamed to SIEM with full fragment URLs and referrers, enabling rapid source takedown.

- **Seamless Access for Clean Content** - GitHub Pages, npm CDN, and govt-site downloads continue uninterrupted when checks pass; developers and end-users see no false positives.

By stopping malware at the **build phase**, SafeSquid renders MaaS fragment tactics powerless-even zero-day binaries cannot execute if the pieces never click together.

## Conclusion

Malware builders no longer need single-file delivery; they rely on browsers to finish the job. Security teams must therefore police **intent**, not just artefacts. SafeSquid's fragment-aware, assembly-blocking engine gives defenders that edge.
