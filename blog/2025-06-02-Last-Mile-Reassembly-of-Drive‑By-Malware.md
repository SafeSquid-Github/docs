## Legacy Defences: Scan the File, Miss the Puzzle

Today, the Malware as a Service (MaaS) ecosystem has democratised access to catastrophic cyberattack capabilities for a very affordable monthly subscription. Attackers can now rent zero‑day exploits on dark‑web marketplaces.

Traditional perimeter defences—anti‑virus proxies, ICAP connectors, next‑gen firewalls—evaluate **whole files** before they reach the endpoint. If the file hash is unknown, a sandbox detonates the sample; if the MIME type is suspicious, the download is blocked. Unfortunately, drive‑by malware splits the executable into chunks that masquerade as CSS sprites, WebP images, or innocuous JSON. No single fragment violates policy, so the download gate opens.

**Client‑Side Reassembly** is the attacker’s force multiplier: WebAssembly glues pieces together in memory, decrypts them with a hard‑coded key, and drops the final payload via the browser’s FileSystem or Service Worker APIs. By the time EDR sees the binary, it is already executing under user context.

## Anatomy of a Malware Infiltration

### 1 Reconnaissance: Subscription‑Grade Exploits

Dark‑web MaaS shops (e.g., **RAMP** or **Exploit‑in**) sell monthly access to browser exploit kits targeting Chrome zero‑days. The attacker selects exploits compatible with the victim’s tech stack and purchase tier.

### 2 Payload Obfuscation: Shred & Encrypt

The binary ransomware is XOR‑split into 8 KB chunks, base64‑wrapped, and served from disparate URLs: an SVG sprite sheet, a fake `update.json`, and a seemingly random PNG. Each part alone is inert; combined they reconstruct the PE file.

### 3 Zero‑Hour Hosting: Fresh Yet Trustworthy

Attackers leverage cloud fronts—GitHub Pages, Azure Blob, S3 buckets—created minutes earlier. Because the domain is tied to a trusted provider and newly registered only at the sub‑domain level, URL filters seldom block access.

### 4 Drive‑By Trigger: One Visit, Many Requests

When the victim visits a compromised blog or malicious ad, an inline `<script>` calls each fragment. Content‑Security‑Policy bypasses are achieved via `data:` URIs or downgraded `blob:` links.

### 5 Last‑Mile Reassembly: Assemble & Drop

A client‑side loader gathers fragments, decrypts them, verifies CRC, concatenates, and writes `invoice_view.exe` to the user’s Downloads folder—or spins up a PowerShell `Add‑Content` pipeline. Endpoint AV sees only an approved process writing a new file.

### 6 Execution & Expansion: Chaos in Motion

The payload runs, encrypts mapped drives, destroys VSS shadow copies, and exfiltrates data to a TOR relay. If ransom is unpaid, data is auctioned on a leak site.

### 7 Burn & Recycle: Disposable Infrastructure

As telemetry catches up, the attacker tears down the blob storage and spins up new containers, ensuring indicators of compromise age out quickly.

## Collateral Impact & Risk

Drive‑by infections cost more than ransom: they trigger regulatory fines, SLA breaches, and loss of IP. The median downtime after a successful browser‑based ransomware drop in 2024 was **6 days** (Coveware Q4 2024).

## SafeSquid’s Anti‑Malware Measures

SafeSquid shifts inspection from *file arrival* to *file assembly*.

- **Fragment Inspection** – Every response, be it CSS, JSON, or image, is scanned for encrypted opcode patterns and suspicious entropy.

- **Assembly Watchdog** – A browser‑helper ruleset blocks JavaScript attempts to `concat`, `atob`, or `WebAssembly.instantiate` untrusted blobs unless the host is on a *Trusted‑Assemble* list.

- **Inline Sandboxing** – Suspicious fragment sets are reconstructed in a headless sandbox; if the hash matches malware families or behaves maliciously, delivery is halted.

- **Violation Telemetry** – Blocked assembly events are streamed to SIEM with full fragment URLs and referrers, enabling rapid source takedown.

- **Seamless Access for Clean Content** – GitHub Pages, npm CDN, and govt‑site downloads continue uninterrupted when checks pass; developers and end‑users see no false positives.

By stopping malware at the **build phase**, SafeSquid renders MaaS fragment tactics powerless—even zero‑day binaries cannot execute if the pieces never click together.

## Conclusion

Malware builders no longer need single‑file delivery; they rely on browsers to finish the job. Security teams must therefore police **intent**, not just artefacts. SafeSquid’s fragment‑aware, assembly‑blocking engine gives defenders that edge.
