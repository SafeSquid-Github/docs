# Configure Cloud Restore



## How Cloud Restore works

**Backup process:**
1. You make configuration changes in SafeSquid Configuration Portal
2. Click **Support → Restart SafeSquid** and select **Yes** for cloud backup
3. SafeSquid uploads `config.xml` and SSL certificates to cloud storage (linked to your activation key)

**Restore process:**
1. Install SafeSquid on new or rebuilt appliance
2. Activate with the same activation key used for backup
3. Click **Cloud Restore** in Configuration Portal
4. SafeSquid downloads and applies the backed-up configuration and SSL certificates
5. Restart SafeSquid to apply restored settings

**Files restored:**
- `/usr/local/safesquid/security/policies/config.xml` (all policies and settings)
- `/usr/local/safesquid/security/ssl/ROOT_X509File.cer` (SSL root certificate)
- `/usr/local/safesquid/security/ssl/ROOT_PrivateKeyFile.pem` (SSL private key)

The restore prompt appears only when SafeSquid finds a cloud backup matching your activation key.



## Prerequisites

- SafeSquid installed and activated with the same activation key on both backup and restore appliances
- Internet connectivity to SafeSquid cloud storage
- Monit service running (required for automatic service restart after restore)

**Check Monit status:**
```bash
systemctl status monit
```

If Monit is not running:
```bash
systemctl start monit
systemctl enable monit
```



## Configure Cloud Restore

After restore completes, SafeSquid restarts automatically. Wait 1-2 minutes for the service to fully start.

## Verify restoration

1. Open Configuration Portal: `http://<proxy-ip>:8888`
2. Navigate to Configure → Access Restriction (or any configured section)
3. Confirm policies match the state from your original appliance
4. Check SSL certificate: Configuration Portal → SSL Inspection → View certificate details
5. Test client connection to verify proxy functionality

**Expected result**: All policies, user groups, and SSL certificates should match the backed-up configuration.

## Trigger manual backup before major changes

Before making risky configuration changes, trigger a manual backup:

1. Configuration Portal → Support → Restart SafeSquid
2. Select **Yes** when prompted "Backup current configuration to cloud?"
3. Click **Submit**

This creates a restore point you can revert to if changes cause issues.

## Troubleshooting

**"No cloud backup found" error:**
- Verify you're using the same activation key that was used for backup
- Check internet connectivity: `ping cloud.safesquid.com` (or SafeSquid cloud endpoint)
- Ensure a backup was actually created (restart with "Yes" for cloud backup on original appliance)

**Restore completes but policies missing:**
- Verify you restarted SafeSquid after restore: Configuration Portal → Support → Restart SafeSquid
- Check file permissions: `ls -l /usr/local/safesquid/security/policies/config.xml` (should be owned by safesquid user)
- Check logs: `tail -f /var/log/safesquid/extended.log` (look for restore errors)

**SSL certificates not working after restore:**
- Verify certificate files exist:
  ```bash
  ls -l /usr/local/safesquid/security/ssl/ROOT_X509File.cer
  ls -l /usr/local/safesquid/security/ssl/ROOT_PrivateKeyFile.pem
  ```
- Reimport SSL certificate to client browsers if needed: [Import Certificate](/docs/SSL_Inspection/Import_Certificate_Chrome_IE/)

**Monit not restarting SafeSquid automatically:**
- Check Monit status: `systemctl status monit`
- Verify Monit configuration includes SafeSquid: `monit status`
- Manually restart if needed: `systemctl restart safesquid`
