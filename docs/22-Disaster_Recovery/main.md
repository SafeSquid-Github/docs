# Disaster Recovery

Disasters or failures can cause loss of configuration and SSL certificates. SafeSquid Cloud Restore stores configuration and certificates in the cloud; the same activation key restores them to the same or a new appliance. Recovery supports single-node restore and clustered deployments. This section links to the Cloud Restore configuration guide.

## Disaster recovery configuration guides

### [Configure Cloud Restore](/docs/Disaster_Recovery/Configure_Cloud_Restore/)
Recovery requires Cloud Restore to be configured and the same activation key. The document covers how Cloud Restore works, required setup (Monit), and step-by-step configuration in the SafeSquid interface. Restoring configuration and SSL certificates from the cloud reduces downtime and rework. Use this document to implement and run disaster recovery.
