# Application Eco-System

Enterprises stitching together multiple security appliances inherit policy drift, inspection blind spots, and operational overhead; effective Layer-7 enforcement therefore demands a single, modular system that integrates cleanly, scales horizontally, and sustains line-rate performance.&#x20;

## Typical High-Level Solution Architecture

SafeSquid’s Application Ecosystem meets this need through an enterprise-grade, cloud-integrated platform; it unifies policy decisions, combines intelligent threat detection with deep content inspection, and supports seamless multi-cloud deployment.

- **Elastic scale:** Clustered proxies grow horizontally without policy drift.

- **Unified L7 control:** Central policy engine delivers consistent outcomes

- **Audit-ready operations:** Built-in reporting/forensics and versioned backups&#x20;

- **Secure by design:** Selective TLS interception, true-MIME validation, and policy-aware DNS to expose intent and block abuse.

### Architectural Planes

Enterprises struggle when a single change in one place breaks traffic in another, or when policy behaves differently across sites. SafeSquid splits responsibilities into planes so each solves a distinct problem without colliding with the others, simplifying scale, upgrades, and audit.

- **Data plane**\
  Modern HTTPS hides intent while users expect instant page loads. Blind pass-through misses attacks; heavy inspection adds latency. The SafeSquid Proxy Cluster sits in the path and resolves this tension: it validates TLS, decrypts selectively under policy, inspects HTTP semantics, scans the content exhanged, and enforces security policies. Nodes remain stateless and scale horizontally behind load balancers.

- **Control plane**\
  The problem is sprawl: dozens of proxies, each with slightly different rules, and risky “all-or-nothing” pushes. The Policy Configuration Console becomes the source of truth. Teams author, simulate, review, and approve changes, then publish with staged rollouts and RBAC. Versioning and diffs make every change auditable and reversible, so updates move quickly without surprises in the data path.

- **Management plane**\
  Licenses, activation keys, and certificate lifecycles scatter across tools and tickets, slowing operators and creating outages. The Self-Service Portal centralises these jobs: activate or renew licenses, manage the enterprise root CA and OCSP/CRL settings, enrol connectors, and adjust organisation settings. Role-scoped access and activity history keep routine administration fast and accountable.

- **Observability plane**\
  Incident response and compliance fail when logs lack context or arrive late. Reporting & Forensics solves this by streaming structured telemetry (JSON/CEF/syslog) with evidence fields. Dashboards show health and policy outcomes in real time, while scheduled CSV/PDF reports satisfy audit cycles without manual exports.

### Typical Web Traffic Flow via SafeSquid Proxy

1. **Client -> Proxy**\
   Client discovers the proxy (PAC/WPAD or WCCP/redirect) and opens TCP to the proxy VIP\
   If proxy auth applies, negotiate 407/Proxy-Authenticate.

2. **HTTPS CONNECT gate**\
   For HTTPS, client issues CONNECT host:443. \
   Policy decides: block, tunnel (splice), or intercept (bump/peek-and-bump).

3. **Client-side TLS**\
   Proxy presents a leaf certificate signed by the enterprise root CA and completes TLS with the client. Enforce client-side protocol, cipher/curve, and ALPN policy.

4. **Policy-Aware DNS Resolution**\
   Extract intended FQDN (from CONNECT target or SNI). Evaluate policy-aware DNS: category, geo-location/ASN, NRD status, and tunnelling patterns.

5. **Server-side connect**\
   Open TCP to the resolved destination (or parent proxy).&#x20;

6. **Server-side TLS**\
   Negotiate TLS (prefer HTTP/2 via ALPN). Validate certificate chain and hostname, check revocation (OCSP/CRL; CT if enabled), and enforce cipher/curve policy. Apply hard-fail or soft-fail per site class.

7. **TLS Decryption**\
   Decrypts the HTTP Communication

8. **Request normalisation**\
   Parse method, path, headers, cookies; decompress if needed (gzip/brotli); resolve absolute vs origin-form; apply header size and URI length limits; assign routing (direct/upstream).

9. **Context Binding**\
   Map the request to user/group (AD/LDAP/Kerberos SSO), device posture (managed/unmanaged, health), network signature, time, and session risk. Classify application and tenant using SNI/SAN, host/path patterns, headers, and cookies; confirm web category and server geo.

10. **Deep content inspection**\
    Verify **true-MIME** via magic bytes; parse containers (archives, OOXML, PDFs); extract embedded objects; enable **OCR** for images when DLP requires it. Run inline **AV heuristics**; invoke **ICAP REQMOD/RESPMOD** for sandbox detonation on suspicious objects; apply **DLP** on upload/download; enforce header/cookie governance (Secure/HttpOnly/SameSite, cookie scoping).



    1. **Deep Content Inspection**\
       Performs deep inspection of information exchanged in the HTTP protocol headers and the payload entities\
       True-MIME type, Image, Malware\
       Inspect magic bytes and container structure; flag MIME mismatches; extract embedded objects;&#x20;

       OCR images for DLP.

       Run AV heuristics; evaluate rules; call ICAP REQMOD/RESPMOD for sandboxing when objects look suspicious; enforce DLP on upload/download; apply header/cookie governance (Secure/HttpOnly/SameSite).

       and \
       **Web Categorisation, Application/Tenant Identification etc**\
       Map request to user/group (AD/LDAP/Kerberos SSO), network signature, server location, time, and session risk.

    2. **Policy Engine**\
       Policy Decision and Enforcement\
       Decide **allow / modify / step-up / isolate (RBI) / rate-limit / deny** with a reason code. Example modifications: strip risky JavaScript, add CSP/HSTS, block WebSockets, neutralize active content.

    3. **Content Filtering**

    4. **Forward and shape**

       On allow, forward upstream, receive response, repeat response-side checks, apply caching directives, re-compress

    5. **TLS Re-Encryption**\
       re‑encrypts the HTTP communication

11. **Telemetry**

    Emit structured logs to Reporting/Forensics and SIEM: request\_id, user\_id, device\_id, policy\_id, decision, reason, tls\_version/cipher, sni/host, true\_mime, dest\_tenant, timings (p95 buckets), ICAP verdicts.

## Core Components

At a high level, the SafeSquid SWG solution consists of the following core components:

1. SafeSquid Proxy Cluster\
   Central enforcement point for all HTTP/HTTPS traffic, performing full proxying, in-line inspection, and enforcement of security policies.

2. Policy Management Console\
   Administrative interface for defining, simulating, and enforcing access control, URL filtering, SSL inspection, DLP, and other security policies.

3. Self-Service Portal\
   Web portal for managing cloud-integrated features, like creating activation keys, license management, configuring Root CA certificates, etc.&#x20;

4. Reporting & Forensics\
   Real-time dashboards, customizable reports and forensic logging for visibility, compliance, and incident investigation.

5. Integrated DNS Security \
   Hardened internal DNS resolver with policy-aware resolution, blocking of malicious domains, and mitigation of DNS tunneling and spoofing attacks.

6. Cloud-Based Configuration Backup & Restore\
   Cloud-synchronized backup system with version-controlled policy snapshots for seamless restoration and rollback in case of failure or misconfiguration.

7. Cloud-Based Threat Intelligence Feeds\
   To ensure your organisation’s security posture has maximum relevance, real-time intelligence feeds are directly injected into the enforcement pipeline.

## Supporting Services

For production use, deploy SafeSquid with Supporting Services for high availability, monitoring and performance enhancement.

1. Monit \
   Monitoring service to ensure zero downtime and optimal performance: continually optimises the system, cleans up temporary files, auto-restarts in case of unexpected shutdowns, and fetches threat intelligence updates.

2. Bind\
   Speeds up the DNS resolutions by utilising Root DNS servers

3. NTP \
   Time synchronizations with the Active directory in SSO configuration

## Integrations

With Enterprise-Ready Integrations, SafeSquid can easily integrate with your IAM systems, ICAP servers, DLP systems, SIEMs, and SoC threat intelligence, to easily blend in your environment.
