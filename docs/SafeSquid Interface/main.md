## [Access the SafeSquid User Interface](https://help.safesquid.com/portal/en/kb/articles/access-the-safesquid-user-interface)

SafeSquid has an intrinsic Web-based UI, that will enable you to manage your instance, configure policies, fine-tune the features, and monitor your secure web gateway. First, create a policy on the top to allow at least one admin account to access the configuration portal to avoid lockout when configuring policies.


## Leverage Proxy Auto-Configuration (PAC)

SafeSquid supports PAC files to enable automatic traffic distribution across proxy clusters.
