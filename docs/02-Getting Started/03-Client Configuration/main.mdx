# Main

After Client configuration, you will be able to access the safesquid Interface

## Overview

SafeSquid Proxy Service has a browser-based intrinsic WebGUI, that allows users to configure, and manage its various features. To access the Interface, you must configure your web browser to use the SafeSquidÂ® proxy server. You should be able to access the WebGUI with the [http://Safesquid.cfg/](http://Safesquid.cfg/)

## Prerequisites

To access the SafeSquid User Interface, you must configure your web browser to use the SafeSquid proxy server. We recommend you configure SafeSquid Proxy into Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox Browser.

For more details - [How to set the proxy in the browser](/docs/17-Operational%20Modes/TCP%20Proxy.md)

You can configure SafeSquid to permit access to the User Interface by only security administrators.

The main page or starting page of the interface displays the dashboard of SafeSquid.

When you access the SafeSquid interface for the first time, it will prompt you to upload your activation.

## [Access the SafeSquid User Interface](https://app.dhub.dev/docs/08-SafeSquid%20Interface/Accessing%20the%20SafeSquid%20Interface.md)

SafeSquid has an intrinsic Web-based UI, that will enable you to manage your instance, configure policies, fine-tune the features, and monitor your secure web gateway. First, create a policy on the top to allow at least one admin account to access the configuration portal to avoid lockout when configuring policies.

## Leverage Proxy Auto-Configuration (PAC)

SafeSquid supports PAC files to enable automatic traffic distribution across proxy clusters.
