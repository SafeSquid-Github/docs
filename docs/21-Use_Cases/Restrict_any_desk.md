## Configuration on anydesk
Set proxy on anydesk application

If authentication is enabled you have to specify Username and Password on any desk application.

Anydesk should not take auto proxy settings: If you set proxy in IE browser or chrome browser and you select "Try to detect the proxy server" option on anydesk, it should not take proxy automatically. You must have to configure proxy on anydesk application.
