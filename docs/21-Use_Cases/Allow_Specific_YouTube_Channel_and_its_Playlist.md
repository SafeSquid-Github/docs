## Client Scenario
Ganpat University provides graduate programs to various colleges. Ganpat University distributes the internet to its students. Ganpat University wants to block entire www.youtube.com for their students, but wants some of the YouTube channels allowed which are helpful for students.

Ganpat University's challenges are:

All Students should not be allowed to access www.youtube.com. If any student tries to access YouTube, the student receives a blocked template.

Only a few of the specified YouTube channels and their playlists should be allowed. This YouTube channel contains educational and knowledge-sharing videos.

## Solution
You can achieve this by creating a policy in the Request Profiles Section and binding it with policies in the Access Profiles Section.

<section class="section-strip">

## Prerequisites
HTTPS Inspection should be enabled in SafeSquid. If not enabled, refer to the document - [How to enable HTTPS Inspection](../05-SSL_Inspection/main.md).

You need the YouTube **Channel-ID** and **List-ID** of the playlist you want to allow. You have to extract the Channel-ID and List-ID of the playlist from the YouTube URL before creating rules in SafeSquid.

## Channel-ID and List-ID Extraction
### Extract Channel-ID from YouTube channel

1. Open the YouTube channel to allow. This example uses the CBT Nuggets channel. The **Channel-ID** appears in the referrer URL as the portion after **'channel/'**. Save it for reference.

CBT Nuggets Channel URL: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClIFqsmxnwVNNlsvjH1D1Aw

**Channel-ID: UClIFqsmxnwVNNlsvjH1D1Aw**

Select any playlist of the channel and click **PLAY ALL**. This example uses the **CBT Nuggets Webinars** playlist.

2. You can extract List-ID from the selected playlist.

**List-ID** is the preceding portion of the URL after the **'&list='** part. Save this part on a notepad for reference.

In our case we have taken playlist **CBT Nuggets Webinars** and its URL is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcB0j6uBJCA&list=PLQVJk9oC5JKo_bMWae3xsavpPMKAzIeGb

Extracted **List-ID: PLQVJk9oC5JKo_bMWae3xsavpPMKAzIeGb**

![Extract List-ID from YouTube Channel to Allow Specific YouTube Channel and its Playlist](/img/How_To/Allow_Specific_YouTube_Channel_and_its_Playlist/image2.webp)

Every video in the playlist URL contains the same List-ID.

URL for next video in CBT Nuggets Webinars playlist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q802E2jsByI&list=PLQVJk9oC5JKo_bMWae3xsavpPMKAzIeGb&index=2

**List-ID: PLQVJk9oC5JKo_bMWae3xsavpPMKAzIeGb**

## Test the Scenario
Now try to open videos other than the CBT Nuggets Webinars playlist of the YouTube Channel CBT Nuggets.

All the other videos will be blocked and the below template will be shown.

![Test policy that Allow Specific YouTube Channel and its Playlist](/img/How_To/Allow_Specific_YouTube_Channel_and_its_Playlist/image21.webp)

You can check the videos from the CBT Nuggets Webinars playlist of the CBT Nuggets channel. Only these videos will be allowed.

:::note
This configuration will work only for videos sourced from the channel page and not from the feeds links or YouTube Videos embedded in website.

To allow all the videos of any specific YouTube Channel you have to insert List-ID's (of every playlist in that channel) and file part (of each individual unlisted video) of the URL in the File field of the Request Types Section.
