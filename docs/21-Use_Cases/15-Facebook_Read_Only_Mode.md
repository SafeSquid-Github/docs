# Allow Facebook viewing but block posting and engagement

Organizations often want to allow Facebook for morale or recruitment but limit risk (cyberbullying, inappropriate posts). SafeSquid can put Facebook into read-only mode: users can view content but not comment, like, or share. Access can be full for social media groups, read-only for others, and time-based (e.g. relaxed at lunch).



## Facebook read-only mode
**Understand the possibilities**

1. Restricted Like, comment and share.
2. Blocking selective Facebook apps.
3. Allow Facebook login only to specific user or group of users.
4. Block Facebook chat.



## Prerequisites
HTTPS Inspection should be enabled in SafeSquid. If not enabled, refer to the document - [How to enable HTTPS Inspection](/docs/SSL_Inspection/main/).
