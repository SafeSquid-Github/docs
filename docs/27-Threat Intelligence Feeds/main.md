# Threat Intelligence Feeds

## Cloud-integrated feeds keep enforcement current

SafeSquid uses cloud-integrated, real-time threat intelligence updates for web categorization, application identification, SSL security, image analysis, malware scanning, and geo-location. Static or infrequently updated data misses new domains, applications, and threats. These feeds inject current intelligence into the enforcement pipeline so policies and blocks reflect the latest risk.

## What threat intelligence feeds provide

Feeds supply data for web categorization (URL and domain classification), application signatures (traffic identification), SSL certificate reputation, image analysis, malware indicators, and server geo-location. SafeSquid consumes these updates and applies them during request and response evaluation. Administrators enable or tune related features in the [Configuration Portal](/docs/SafeSquid%20SWG/Configuration%20Portal); feed delivery and refresh are managed by the SafeSquid cloud service.

## Relevance and timeliness improve security posture

Up-to-date intelligence improves accuracy of access restriction, malware blocking, and compliance reporting. Stale data allows bypass or false positives. Real-time, cloud-integrated feeds keep the organization's security posture aligned with current threats and categorization.
