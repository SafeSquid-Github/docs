## Insider threats and data loss demand gateway controls

Surveys of IT security professionals show that many organizations have major gaps in protecting against insider threats. Not all data loss comes from external attacks. Inadvertent disclosure or mishandling of confidential data by employees is a significant factor. Weak IT security across devices invites hackers and fraudsters. Data loss ranks as the top concern; common insider issues include data leaks (63%), inadvertent breaches (57%), and malicious breaches (53%). The role of insiders in corporate vulnerability is large and growing.

Insiders include both malicious actors and inattentive or complacent employees with no malicious intent.

Internal attacks include data leakage, intellectual property theft, and data corruption or loss.

SafeSquid mitigates insider threats with advanced security and risk-management solutions.

SafeSquid's DLP module addresses data leakage. The DLP module restricts users from downloading or uploading specific file types. In-memory virus scanners such as SqScan block virus-infected uploads and downloads. Role-based access keeps the organization protected from internal attacks.

## Capabilities provided by SafeSquid

**Data loss prevention**

Data loss prevention (DLP) ensures that end users do not send sensitive or critical information outside the corporate network. DLP software lets network administrators control what data end users can transfer. Studies show that internal data leakage often outweighs external leakage. Insider threat is hard to guard when someone uses legitimate access for improper purposes. DLP detects files containing confidential information and prevents them from leaving via the network.

Below are general statistics regarding data leakage.

**In-memory virus scanning**

Malware reaches systems mainly through the Internet and the web. No single method fully secures a computer. Multiple layers of defense reduce the chance of compromise.

Administrators can integrate different virus scanners in the ICAP module. By default SafeSquid includes the SqScan virus engine, which blocks uploads and downloads of infected files.

**Role-based access**

Large networks have many users; provisioning correct access for everyone is difficult. Granting full access to all users causes backlogs, long waits, bandwidth loss, and unnecessary rights that increase breach risk.

SafeSquid supports role-based access for provisioning. Administrators restrict user access by role and can integrate any centralized user management system with SafeSquid.

**Real-time monitoring**

Real-time monitoring (e.g. SafeSquid Reporting Module) provides visibility into the system and alerts when conditions look wrong.

Example: if four new users were granted access to a critical application in one week, the administrator can be alerted. Real-time monitoring surfaces such events so the administrator can investigate and mitigate breach risk.
