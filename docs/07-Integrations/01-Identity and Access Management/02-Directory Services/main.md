The **Directory Services** section in **SafeSquid** allows you to configure directory services for user authentication and management, integrating with existing identity management systems.

## Included Topics
- [Active Directory](/docs/07-Integrations/01-Identity%20and%20Access%20Management/02-Directory%20Services/01-Active%20Directory/main.md): Configure and integrate Active Directory for centralized user management and authentication.
- [OpenLDAP](/docs/07-Integrations/01-Identity%20and%20Access%20Management/02-Directory%20Services/02-OpenLDAP/main.md): Set up and configure OpenLDAP for user authentication and directory management.

These configurations enable seamless user authentication and policy enforcement, leveraging existing directory services.
