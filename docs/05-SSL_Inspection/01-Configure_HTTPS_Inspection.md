# Configure HTTPS Inspection

This guide covers the complete HTTPS inspection setup: generate or import a Root CA certificate, enable inspection in SafeSquid, deploy the certificate to clients, and configure bypass rules for sensitive domains.

**Time to complete:** 30-60 minutes (including client certificate deployment)

## Prerequisites

:::info Before You Start

**SafeSquid side:**
- SafeSquid installed and licensed
- Access to [Self-Service Portal](https://key.safesquid.com) (for certificate generation)
- Access to SafeSquid Configuration Portal (`http://safesquid.cfg/` or `https://SERVER-IP:8443/`)

**Client side:**
- List of domains to bypass (banking, healthcare, SSL-pinned apps)
- Method to deploy Root CA to all clients (GPO, MDM, or manual)
- Administrative access to client systems (for certificate import)

:::

## Step 1: Generate or Import Root CA Certificate

You have three options for the Root CA certificate:

| **Option** | **When to Use** | **Pros** | **Cons** |
|------------|-----------------|----------|----------|
| **Self-Signed** | Testing, small deployments | Quick, no external dependencies | Not trusted by default, harder to revoke |
| **Enterprise CA (with passphrase)** | Production with existing CA | Centralized trust, auditable | Requires CA infrastructure |
| **Enterprise CA (without passphrase)** | Production, new passphrase | Same as above | Need to set new passphrase |

**Recommended:** Use self-signed for testing/pilot. Use enterprise CA for production.

---

### Generate Certificate in Self-Service Portal

1. **Log in** to the [Self-Service Portal](https://key.safesquid.com/)

   ![Self-Service Portal login](/img/SSL_Inspection/image1.webp)

2. **Navigate to Certificate Management**

   In the dashboard → find your deployment → click **Manage Certificate**

    - All sections are fully configured for production
    
    Otherwise, select "No" to save locally only.
    
    :::

---

## Step 3: Deploy Root CA to Clients

All clients must trust the SafeSquid Root CA to avoid certificate warnings.

### Windows (Chrome, Edge, IE)

**See detailed guide:** [Import Certificate into Chrome/IE](/docs/SSL_Inspection/Import_Certificate_Chrome_IE/)

**Quick summary:**
1. Double-click the downloaded certificate
2. **Install Certificate** → **Local Machine** → **Next**
3. **Browse** → **Trusted Root Certification Authorities** → **OK**
4. **Next** → **Finish**

**For enterprise deployment:** Use GPO to push the certificate to all Windows machines.

---

### Firefox (All Platforms)

Firefox uses its own certificate store.

1. **Download the SafeSquid Root CA** (from Step 1)
2. **Open Firefox** → **Settings** → **Privacy & Security** → **Certificates** → **View Certificates**
3. **Authorities tab** → **Import**
4. **Select the SafeSquid certificate file**
5. **Check "Trust this CA to identify websites"** → **OK**

**Verify:**
- Visit `https://www.google.com` (via SafeSquid proxy)
- Click padlock → **More information** → **View Certificate**
- Certificate chain should show SafeSquid Root CA

---

### macOS

**Via System Keychain:**
1. Double-click the certificate file
2. **Add** → Enter admin password
3. **Open Keychain Access** → **System** keychain
4. Find SafeSquid certificate → **Get Info**
5. **Trust** section → **When using this certificate** → **Always Trust**

**For enterprise:** Use MDM (Jamf, Intune) to deploy to all Macs.

---

### Mobile Devices

**iOS/Android:**
- Deploy via MDM (Jamf, Intune, Workspace ONE)
- Manual: Email certificate → Open on device → Install

---

## Step 4: Configure Bypass Policies

Bypass HTTPS inspection for:
- Banking and financial sites (compliance)
- Healthcare portals (HIPAA)
- SSL-pinned applications (will break otherwise)
- Government sites

---

### Enable Default Bypass Policy

1. **Click "Configure"** in SafeSquid interface

   ![Click Configure](/img/SSL_Inspection/image30.webp)

2. **Click Search** (magnifying glass icon, top right)

   ![Click Search](/img/SSL_Inspection/image31.webp)

3. **Type "BYPASS SSL INSPECTION"** → **Enter**

   ![Search bypass](/img/SSL_Inspection/image32.webp)

4. **Click Edit** on the bypass policy

   ![Edit bypass policy](/img/SSL_Inspection/image33.webp)

5. **Set "Enabled" to "True"** → **Save Policy**

   ![Enable bypass](/img/SSL_Inspection/image34.webp)
   ![Save bypass policy](/img/SSL_Inspection/image35.webp)

6. **Review and enable related bypass policies** (for banking apps, Windows Update, etc.)

   ![Review bypass policies](/img/SSL_Inspection/image36.webp)

---

### Create Custom Bypass for Specific Domains

**Example:** Bypass HTTPS inspection for Dropbox.

![Custom bypass example](/img/SSL_Inspection/image37.webp)

**Step 1: Define Request Type**

1. **Sidebar** → **Profiling Engine** → **Request Types** → **Add New**

   ![Request Types](/img/SSL_Inspection/image38.webp)
   ![Add New](/img/SSL_Inspection/image39.webp)

2. **Comment:** "Dropbox domains"  
   **Match pattern:** `.*dropbox.*`  
   **Smart TLD:** True

   ![Define Dropbox pattern](/img/SSL_Inspection/image40.webp)
   ![Enable Smart TLD](/img/SSL_Inspection/image41.webp)

**Step 2: Create Access Policy**

3. **Sidebar** → **Access Policies** → **Access Profiles** → **Add New**

   ![Access Profiles](/img/SSL_Inspection/image42.webp)

4. **Comment:** "Bypass SSL for Dropbox"  
   **Request Type:** Select "Dropbox domains" (from Step 1)  
   **Added profiles:** Select "BYPASS SSL INSPECTION"

   ![Create bypass policy](/img/SSL_Inspection/image43.webp)

5. **Save Policy**

   ![Save bypass](/img/SSL_Inspection/image44.webp)

6. **Save Configuration** (floppy disk icon, bottom left)

**Test:** Upload/download files via Dropbox to verify bypass works.

---

## Verification

### Test HTTPS Inspection is Working

**On a client with SafeSquid Root CA installed:**

1. **Browse to** `https://www.google.com`
2. **Click padlock** → **Certificate** → **View**
3. **Verify:** Certificate chain shows SafeSquid Root CA as the issuer
4. **No certificate warnings** should appear

**Expected certificate chain:**
```
www.google.com (issued by SafeSquid Root CA)
  └─ SafeSquid Root CA (self-signed or your enterprise CA)
```

---

### Test Bypass is Working

**On the same client:**

1. **Browse to a bypassed site** (e.g., banking site you added to bypass)
2. **Click padlock** → **Certificate** → **View**
3. **Verify:** Certificate shows the **original site's CA** (not SafeSquid)

**Expected:** Bypassed sites show their original certificates (e.g., DigiCert, Let's Encrypt).

---

### Check SafeSquid Logs

**On SafeSquid server:**

```bash
tail -f /var/log/safesquid/access/extended.log
```

**Expected for inspected sites:**
- Full URL logged (including path, not just domain)
- `200 OK` or similar HTTP status

**Expected for bypassed sites:**
- Only `CONNECT` method logged
- No detailed path information

---

## Troubleshooting

| **Issue** | **Likely Cause** | **Fix** |
|-----------|------------------|---------|
| Certificate warnings on all HTTPS sites | Root CA not installed on client | Install SafeSquid Root CA in Trusted Root store (see Step 3) |
| Firefox shows warnings, Chrome works | Firefox uses separate cert store | Import certificate into Firefox separately (see above) |
| Banking/healthcare sites broken | HTTPS inspection enabled, no bypass | Add sites to bypass policy (Step 4) |
| Mobile apps not working | SSL pinning | Add app's domains to bypass policy |
| "NET::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID" | Root CA not trusted | Verify certificate installed in **Trusted Root Certification Authorities** (not Intermediate) |
| Inspection works, then stops | SafeSquid restart cleared config | Re-save configuration; check if config was saved to cloud |
| Some sites work, others don't | Partial bypass or incorrect policy | Review bypass policies; check logs for CONNECT vs full requests |

**Still not working?**

1. **Verify HTTPS Inspection is enabled:**
   - Configuration Portal → Real-time Content Security → HTTPS Inspection → Global = True

2. **Check certificate is deployed:**
   - Windows: Run `certmgr.msc` → Trusted Root Certification Authorities → Certificates
   - Firefox: Settings → Privacy & Security → Certificates → View Certificates → Authorities
   - macOS: Keychain Access → System → Find SafeSquid cert

3. **Test with curl:**
   ```bash
   # Should work without cert if bypass is correct:
   curl --proxy http://SAFESQUID-IP:8080 https://www.google.com
   ```

4. **Check SafeSquid logs:**
   ```bash
   tail -50 /var/log/safesquid/safesquid.log
   grep -i "ssl\|cert\|handshake" /var/log/safesquid/safesquid.log
   ```
