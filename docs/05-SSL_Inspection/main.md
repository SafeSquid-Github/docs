# HTTPS inspection for policy and threat visibility

Encrypted HTTPS traffic conceals malicious payloads, phishing attempts, and data leakage. Enterprises need visibility for web usage policies, malware scanning, and data exfiltration prevention. SafeSquid inspects HTTPS traffic with policy-based bypass so privacy-sensitive domains (e.g. banking, healthcare) can remain uninspected for compliance.

This section links to the document that covers certificate setup, enabling inspection, and verification.

## HTTPS inspection configuration and verification

### [Configure HTTPS Inspection](01-Configure_HTTPS_Inspection.md)
HTTPS traffic must be decrypted for policy enforcement and threat prevention. The document covers prerequisites, certificate generation or import via the Self-Service Portal, and enabling inspection in the Configuration Portal. Bypass rules and client Root CA import support compliance-sensitive domains and audit evidence. Follow the document to deploy and validate HTTPS inspection end-to-end.
