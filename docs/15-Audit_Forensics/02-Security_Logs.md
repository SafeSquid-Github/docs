## Logs support troubleshooting and analysis

Logs provide a timeline of events for the OS and applications and are a primary troubleshooting tool. When an issue occurs, the system administrator analyzes log files first. Most logs are plain text under /var/log. With SafeSquid installed, two log types matter: SafeSquid application logs and SafeSquid activity logs (in system logs). To view a log file, use one of:
```bash
less /var/log/logfilename
```
```bash
more -f /var/log/logfilename
```
```bash
 /var/log/logfilename
```
```bash
tail -f /var/log/logfilename
```
```bash
grep -i error /var/log/logfilename
```

## SafeSquid Application Logs

SafeSquid application produces these logs. Logs contain all kinds of error messages, warnings or other events written by the SafeSquid. These messages provide logical, high-level information for specific use cases. Each log message helps administrators understand SafeSquid behavior.
SafeSquid application generates six different log formats.
These logs are named safesquid.log (Native logs), extended.log (NCSA/Extended logs), config.log (Config logs), and performance.log (Performance logs).
Two more log formats were added subsequently as bypass.log and privacy.log.
The path to these log files are as follows:

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Log File**             **Path**
  ------------------------ ----------------------------------------------
  **safesquid.log**        **/var/log/safesquid/native/**

  **extended.log**         **/var/log/safesquid/extended/**

  **config.log**           **/var/log/safesquid/config/**

  **performance.log**      **/var/log/safesquid/performance/**

  **bypass.log**           **/var/log/safesquid/bypass/**

  **privacy.log**          **/var/log/safesquid/privacy/**
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

View Native Log and Config Log details from the **SafeSquid Interface**.

### Native logs

It records various functional aspects like REQUESTS, SECURITY, REDIRECT etc. that are affected by the various features and their configuration.

Control the verbosity of the Native log by specifying LOGLEVEL, as shown in the table below.
The LOGLEVEL parameter affects only the SafeSquid's Native log.

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Value**    **Process logged**      **Value**    **Process logged**
  ------------ ----------------------- ------------ -----------------------
  1            Requests                16384        Forwarding

  2            Network                 32768        Sync

  4            LDAP                    65536        Antivirus

  8            Header filtering        131072       External parser

  16           Interface Request       262144       ICAP

  32           Cookie filtering        524288       SSL

  64           Redirect                1048576      Category

  128          Template                2097152      URL command

  256          Text Analyzer           4194304      Modules

  512          Rewriting               8388608      Security

  1024         Limits                  16777216     Warning

  2048         Caching                 33554432     Error

  4096         Prefetching             67108864     Profiles

  8192         ICP                     134217728    Debug
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------

To record only requests set LOGLEVEL to 1; to record only caching set LOGLEVEL to 2048. To record rewriting, limits, and forwarding set LOGLEVEL to 512 + 1024 + 16384 (17920). To log everything (risk: very large log file quickly) set LOGLEVEL to the sum of all values in the table, 134217727—also the default if LOGLEVEL is commented out. For debug logs only set LOGLEVEL to 134217728. For all activities plus debug set LOGLEVEL to 268435455.

:::note
Adjusting this value requires a restart of SafeSquid service.
:::
This file stored all data related **to every request and response** processed by the SafeSquid. These logs will be useful for debugging purpose.

### Performance logs
Performance logs will be helpful to analyze the performance of SafeSquid.
SafeSquid Performance logs provide performance metrics to identify any outage due to resource shortfall, or failure in Internet Connectivity, or surge in web-traffic, etc.
SafeSquid performance log has been extended to make it easier for analysis with third-party software such as GNU Plot that analyzes records on a progressive per line basis.

  ------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Time Stamp (YYYYMMDDhhmmss)                 Time when SafeSquid generated this record and stored in performance log. SafeSquid begins printing of each record on a new line with the first column as the TimeStamp in YYYYMMDDhhmmss format.
                                              Example> Log line1 was loged at 2018 September, 5th at 17:21:37 hence it displays 20180905172137 in YYYYMMDDhhmmss format.

  Elapsed Time                                Time in seconds since the SafeSquid process started. This is the time in seconds since the process started.
                                              Example> Log line1 reports that SafeSquid process running from last 1603 seconds.

  Client Connections Handled                  Total Client Connections handled by SafeSquid since the start of process.
                                              Example> Log line1 reports that since SafeSquid process running (from 1603 seconds), process handled 21151 incoming connections.

  Client Connections Closed                   Total Client Connections closed by SafeSquid since the start of process.
                                              Example> Log line1 reports that since the start of the process, SafeSquid had closed 20941 incoming connections.
                                              Thus we can interpret that at 2018-05-09 17:21:37 there were 21151 - 20941 = 210 concurrent incoming client connections. So while the 3rd counter and 4th counter are not very significant by themselves, their differential value is very important as it gives a an idea about concurrent connections being handled at any point.

  Client Transactions Handled                 Total Number of transactions handled between clients and SafeSquid since the start of the process. Within each connection a client may send multiple requests, to service these requests SafeSquid may have to transact multiple HTTP transactions.
                                              Example> Log line1 reports that since start of the process, SafeSquid had handled 44316 transactions.

  Client Connections in Pool                  Connections in local pool of SafeSquid. After request handling each connection is been kept in client connection pool for persistence.
                                              SafeSquid may not forcibly close a client connection after performing a transaction within, and even wait for sometime allowing the client to reuse a connection after a few seconds. Such connections are maintained in a "Client Pool".
                                              Example> Log line1 reports that there were 119 client connections that were idling in the client pool. Thus out of the 210 concurrent connections (derived above), 119 were in the client pool and the remaining 91 were either actively transacting, or maybe in the various stages of closure.

  Spare Client Threads                        Additional number of Threads that SafeSquid may produce to service client requests when SafeSquid printed this record.
                                              Example> Log line1 reports that SafeSquid can still produce 8016 client requests.

  Client Threads in Use                       Concurrent Requests being serviced by SafeSquid when SafeSquid printed this record.
                                              Example> Log line1 reports that SafeSquid had used 91 threads to fulfill client requests.

  Client Threads in Waiting                   Threads just released by client requests and available for instantly servicing a client request when SafeSquid printed this record.
                                              Example> Log line1 reports that at present 68 client threads are in waiting state.

  Threads Starting up                         Some Threads already assigned for some sections when SafeSquid starts, these are special threads of SafeSquid.
                                              Example> Log line1 reports that at present 17 threads are used by SafeSquid for internal processes.

  Outbound Connections created                Total New connections created by SafeSquid to various remote webservers to service a client request.
                                              Example> Log line1 shows total 13640 new connections created by SafeSquid.

  Outbound Connections Failed                 Total Number of Events since the start of the process, when SafeSquid failed to create a connection to various remote webservers to service a client request. Example> Log line1 shows total 975 failed outbound connections.

These connections are been reused so that additional burden on server of creating too many connections on server be lower down. Total reused connection till current time.
                                              Example> Log line1 shows 20650 outbound connections are been reused from connection pool from last 1603 seconds.

  User Time                                   User time is the amount of CPU time spent in user-mode code (outside the kernel) within the process. i.e. actual CPU time consumed by SafeSquid processes. Example> Log line2 shows Cumulated CPU time consumed by SafeSquid processes is 60.000000

  System Time                                 System time is the amount of CPU time spent in the kernel within the process. This means executing CPU time spent in system calls within the kernel, as opposed to library code, which is still running in user-space. Like 'user', this is only CPU time used by the process.
                                              Example> Log line2 shows system time consumed by SafeSquid processes is 56.000000

  Total (user + system) Time                  User + System will tell you how much actual CPU time your process used. Note that this is across all CPUs, so if the process has multiple threads it could potentially exceed the wall clock time reported by Real. Note that in the output these figures include the User and System time of all child processes as well, although the underlying system calls return the statistics for the process and its children separately.
                                              Example> Log line2 shows Cumulated Total of CPU Time consumed due to SafeSquid processes is 116.000000

  User Time Delta                             Difference between two consecutive entries of total user time i.e. [CPU time used by SafeSquid at present - CPU time used by SafeSquid before 2 seconds]. Example> Log line2 shows User Time Delta = 0.000000

  System Time Delta                           Difference between two consecutive entries of total system time i.e. [CPU time used by SafeSquid at present  - CPU time used by SafeSquid before 2 seconds]. Example> Log line2 shows System Time Delta = 0.000000

  Total Time Delta                            Difference between two consecutive entries of total (system + user) time i.e. [Present (user+system) time used by SafeSquid - (user+system) time used by SafeSquid before 2 seconds]. Example> Log line2 shows Total Time Delta = 0.000000

### Privacy logs

Privacy Logs are used to record incidences of cookies, and queries going to third-party web sites.
Privacy log captures incidences of third-party web-sites when a user accesses a web-site, and action taken by elevated privacy.

**FORMAT / LEGEND**:

YYYY/mm/DD:HH:MM:SS    ClientID    username@IP    HTTP-REFERRER    METHOD    URL    [USER_AGENT]    action

The details of the fields in privacy.log are as follows:

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Field**               **Explanation**
  ----------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  YYYY/mm/DD: HH:MM: SS   Time when SafeSquid generated this record and stored in privacy log. SafeSquid begins printing of each record on a new line with the first column as the TimeStamp in YYYY/mm/DD: HH:MM: SS format.

  ClientID            The internal SafeSquid ID associated with the present/ongoing connection.

  username@IP             The username@IP(or user ID) used by the client for authentication. If no value is present, "anonymous" is substituted.

  HTTP-REFERRER           An HTTP header field that identifies the address of the age that linked to the resource being requested. "-" is substituted when there is no referrer in HTTP header field.

  METHOD                  A method is part of HTTP request sent by client to the server.

  URL                     An HTTP url is a reference to a web resource that specifies its location on a computer network and a mechanism for retrieving it.

   [USER_AGENT]         User agent is the client which initiates a request. Useraagent are often browsers, editors, spiders(web-traversing robots), or other end user tools.

  action                  Action is the privacy level applied to the request.

## SafeSquid activity log written in system logs

The path to these log files is as follows:

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Log File                    Path
  --------------------------- -------------------------------------------
  **Monit Log**               **/var/log/monit.log**

  **Syslog**                  **/var/log/syslog**
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

### Monit log

SafeSquid Uses Monit service for managing and monitoring its process. Monit service is particularly useful for monitoring daemon processes, such as those started at system boot time. While Monit service is running and if SafeSquid process is terminated either manually or automatically then SafeSquid will be restarted. Also, Monit service plays a crucial role when user want to modify any startup parameter or upgrade the SafeSquid version.

**FORMAT**:

[date] priority : message

**Example Log Lines**:

### Syslog

Linux's syslog service provides a highly configurable logging system. Some messages triggered by SafeSquid application are been stored in syslog. Syslog is a standard log for sending and receiving notification messages--in a particular format--from various network devices. The messages include time stamps, event messages, severity, host IP addresses, diagnostics and more.
Syslog was designed to monitor network devices and systems to send out notification messages if there are any issues with functioning--it also sends out alerts for pre-notified events and monitors suspicious activity via the change log/event log of participating network devices.
You will find log lines of SafeSquid application in the syslog file.
