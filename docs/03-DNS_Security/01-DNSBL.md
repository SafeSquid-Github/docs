# DNS Blacklisting



## Why use DNS Blacklisting?

Unrestricted DNS resolution allows clients to reach domains listed as malicious in threat feeds. DNSBL blocks these connections at the resolution layer-before any traffic is exchanged-reducing exposure to malware, phishing, and botnet callbacks.

| Use DNSBL When | Use Access Restrictions Instead |
|----------------|---------------------------------|
| Blocking known-malicious infrastructure | Blocking specific URL categories (Adult, Social) |
| Early threat mitigation is required | Policy requires deep content analysis |
| Using SOC-provided threat feeds | Blocking individual sites/FQDNs |
| Reducing bandwidth waste from botnets | Enforcing user-specific access rules |

## Prerequisites

- SafeSquid SWG installed and operational.
- SafeSquid configured as the primary DNS resolver (see [Supporting Services: BIND](/docs/SafeSquid_SWG/Supporting_Services/Bind/)).
- A valid DNSBL service domain (e.g., `in.dnsbl.org` or a private threat intel list).
- Outbound network access to the DNSBL service.



## Configure DNSBL in Real-time content security

1. [Access the SafeSquid User Interface](/docs/SafeSquid_SWG/Configuration_Portal/).
2. Open the Configure page.
3. Go to Real-time content security.

4. Open the DNS Blacklist section.

5. Set Global options:
   - **Enabled**: TRUE to enable DNSBL; FALSE to skip querying blacklist services.
   - **Template**: Name of the block template displayed when a domain is blocked. Leave blank for default "blocked" message.
   - **Domain**: DNSBL service domain for queries (e.g., `in.dnsbl.org`). SafeSquid appends this to queried domains: `example.com.in.dnsbl.org`.
   - **Blocked IP addresses**: Comma-separated IP ranges that trigger a block when returned by the DNSBL (e.g., `127.0.0.1-127.0.0.6` for in.dnsbl.org).

:::tip DNSBL Service Compatibility
Administrators can use any DNS-based blacklist service (e.g., Spamhaus, local threat feed). Configure the **Domain** and **Blocked IP addresses** fields to match your service's return codes.

### Understanding Return IP Codes (in.dnsbl.org)

When SafeSquid queries `in.dnsbl.org`, the service returns specific IP addresses indicating threat categories:

| Return IP | Category | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| 127.0.0.2 | UCE | Unsolicited commercial email |
| 127.0.0.3 | Fraud | Financial fraud, phishing |
| 127.0.0.4 | Spam Promo | Promotional spam |
| 127.0.0.5 | Illegal Content | Illegal or harmful content |
| 127.0.0.6 | Pre-emptive | Pre-emptive blocking |
| 127.0.0.7 | List Practices | Improper list practices |
| 127.0.0.8 | Botnet/Malware | Botnet C&C, malware delivery |

**Configuration:** To block all categories, set **Blocked IP addresses** to `127.0.0.1-127.0.0.8`.

---

6. Save. SafeSquid caches DNSBL query results for efficiency.

### Example: block sites via DNSBL server

Use blacklisting domain in.dnsbl.org and blocked IP addresses 127.0.0.1-127.0.0.6. SafeSquid blocks all matching domains and displays the blocked template. Use DNSBL when a SOC provides the list or when many domains must be blocked.

## Verify configuration and blocked requests

- **Interface**: Confirm DNS Blacklist is enabled, Domain and Blocked IP addresses are set, and Template is correct.
- **Block test**: Request a domain known to be listed; expect block page and no connection to origin.
- **Logs**: In [Security Logs](/docs/Audit_Forensics/Security_Logs/), confirm entries for blocked requests (action/result indicating DNSBL block).
- **Audit**: Run a report filtered by block reason or DNSBL; export for evidence that the control is active and blocking malicious domains.



## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Symptom | Resolution |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| **DNSBL service unreachable** | Blocks not applied; DNS timeouts | **Check:** Network connectivity to DNSBL service. **Verify:** Firewall allows outbound DNS (UDP/TCP 53) to DNSBL domain. **Test:** `nslookup example.com.in.dnsbl.org` from SafeSquid server. |
| **Wrong blocked-IP range** | No blocks or incorrect blocks | **Fix:** Align **Blocked IP addresses** with your DNSBL provider's return codes. Example: `127.0.0.1-127.0.0.8` for in.dnsbl.org. **Verify:** Query a known-bad domain and check what IP the DNSBL returns. |
| **Cache causing stale results** | Site unblocked after DNSBL update | **Cause:** SafeSquid caches DNSBL responses for performance. **Fix:** Wait for cache expiry (TTL-based) or restart SafeSquid: `systemctl restart safesquid`. |
| **False positive blocks** | Legitimate site blocked | **Identify:** Check DNSBL query logs to confirm it's a list issue. **Fix:** Add domain to bypass/allow-list in Access Restrictions. **Alternative:** Switch to a different DNSBL provider with lower false-positive rates. |
| **DNSBL enabled but no blocks** | Malicious sites still accessible | **Check:** 1) **Enabled** is TRUE. 2) **Domain** field is correct. 3) **Blocked IP addresses** includes the range returned by your DNSBL. **Test:** Query a known-malicious domain (use a test entry from your DNSBL provider). |
| **Direct IP access bypasses DNSBL** | Users access sites by IP instead of hostname | **Limitation:** DNSBL only works on DNS queries, not direct IP connections. **Mitigation:** Use [Access Restriction](/docs/Access_Restriction/) to block by IP range or category. |
