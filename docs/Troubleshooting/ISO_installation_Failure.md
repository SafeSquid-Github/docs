# ISO Installation Failure

## Issues

When you misconfigure any of your DNS IP, Gateway, or the NIC card, you will face issues such as "**Failed to retrieve the pre-configuration file**".

The IP address that you assigned for the SafeSquid proxy if blocked because of the firewall, will face the issue of a "**Bad archive mirror**". This is typically an error with the server failing to connect to the Internet.

**Note**: If you face any error while installing SafeSquid Appliance Builder (SAB-ISO), you will get debugging logs information by pressing **ALT+F4**. To return to the previous screen press **ALT+F1**.
