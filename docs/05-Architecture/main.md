# SafeSquid Secure Web Gateway Architecture

SafeSquid’s architecture delivers a modular, cloud-integrated solution built for enterprise-grade Layer 7 web security. The architecture combines intelligent threat detection, deep content inspection, centralized policy enforcement, and seamless multi-cloud deployment. This document provides a high-level overview of its three major components—Application Eco-System, Self-Service Portal, and the underlying directory structure.


## 1. [Application Eco-System](/docs/05-Architecture/Application_Eco-System.md)

The Application Eco-System forms the operational backbone of SafeSquid SWG, integrating real-time threat intelligence, DNS-based security, data analytics, and system monitoring to ensure a secure and optimized web access environment. It facilitates automated backups, configuration recovery, and performance tuning through supporting services like Monit, Bind, and NTP, making it essential for reliable deployment and performance.



## 2. [Management of Self-Service Portal](/docs/05-Architecture/Management_of_Self-Service_Portal.md)

The Self-Service Portal provides a unified cloud-based interface to manage activation keys, apply custom web categorization, configure VPN clients for roaming users, and enforce organization-wide SSL and DLP policies. It ensures centralized governance and simplifies configuration across distributed SafeSquid installations, helping administrators maintain consistency and control with minimal overhead.


## 3. [SafeSquid SWG Directory Structure](/docs/05-Architecture/SafeSquid_SWG_directorys.md)

SafeSquid’s directory structure adheres to the Linux Filesystem Hierarchy Standard and logically organizes files related to service initialization, log management, module loading, UI rendering, and system performance tuning. It separates critical components such as SSL certificates, content filtering modules, DLP, caching, and analytics, ensuring easy maintenance, debugging, and extensibility.
