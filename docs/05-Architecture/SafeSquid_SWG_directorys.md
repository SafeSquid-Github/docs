# SafeSquid Secure Web Gateway Directories

SafeSquid installation and operational directories adhere to the Linux Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) and house core components for Layer 7 security, system management, and performance optimization. Key directories and their purposes are outlined below:

## SafeSquid Installation Directory 

>   **/usr/local/safesquid**

The diretory contains all core SafeSquid Web Gateway components. The executables and libraries enable Layer 7 security, threat mitigation, throughput acceleration, and system management capabilities.

## SafeSquid service init scripts 

>   **/etc/init.d/safesquid**

Contains scripts for managing SafeSquid services, including initialisation, termination, and status checks. The SafeSquid script supports commands such as **\{start|stop|restart|status|foreground\}** for service control. The service is configured to start automatically on system boot, ensuring all necessary dependencies and environmental variables are set during initialisation. This script is frequently used to manage the SafeSquid service operations.

## TCP Tuning Script

>   **/etc/init.d/tcp_tune.sh**

SafeSquid stores **tcp_tune.sh** script in the directory **/etc/init.d/** for TCP Tunning. This script will optimise/set some of the values of the TCP parameters like 

-   maximum number of packets to put in the queue before delivery to the upper layer. 

-   the default and maximum write (receiving) and read (sending) buffer size allocated to any connection. 

-   the maximum number of pending requests to put in the queue before processing one connection. 

-   The port ranges are available for a new connection. 

-   whether to reset new connections if the system is currently overflowed with new connection attempts that the daemon(s) cannot handle. 

-   how long to keep sockets in a wait state after connections are closed. 

-   Keep-alive parameters for overall stability and system resource utilization. 

-   maximum number of remembered connection requests, that have not received an acknowledgment from the connecting client. 

-   TCP receives memory and transmits buffer size. 

-   whether to allow to reuse of TIME-WAIT sockets for new connections. 

SafeSquid stores the modified TCP parameters into **/tmp/sysctl_.conf** file for debugging purposes. 

## SafeSquid Log Management Script 

>   **/etc/logrotate.d/safesquid**

The SafeSquid log management script automates the rotation and archiving of log files exceeding 1GB in size using the **logrotate** utility. Logs are compressed into GZIP format to optimize disk space usage. By default, **logrotate** runs daily via a cron scheduler, ensuring systematic log management to prevent disk space exhaustion.

## Monit configuration file for SafeSquid 

>   **/etc/monit/conf.d/safesquid.monit**

Enables the **Monit** to monitor the SafeSquid service. If the service stops or fails, **Monit** automatically restarts it without user intervention. The file is placed in the **conf.d** directory to preserve the original configuration and provide seamless service management and monitoring.

## PAM Configuration File for SafeSquid 

>   **/etc/pam.d/safesquid**

Defines PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) settings for SafeSquid. PAM provides a modular framework for authentication, leveraging **libpam** and dynamically linked modules (**.so** files). SafeSquid utilizes the pam_unix.so module for Unix-based authentication (using **/etc/shadow** and **/etc/passwd**) and the pam_permit.so module for universal access permissions. PAM ensures secure user authentication and resource allocation.

SafeSquid uses **pam_unix.so** and **pam_permit.so** files. 

-   pam_unix: This is the standard Unix authentication module. It performs authentication against hashed passwords stored in **/etc/shadow** file and **/etc/passwd** file. 

-   pam_permit: This module always permits access and returns success. It does nothing else.   

 

## System Tuning Configuration File 

>   **/etc/sysctl.conf**

Contains the system tuning parameters, to increase the performance. SafeSquid modifies and saves this file for setting system variables. This file is a preload /configuration file that is used to modify kernel parameters at runtime. These parameters are listed under the**/proc/sys** directory. 

SafeSquid optimizes various Linux networking and system settings such as: 

-   Improves memory-intensive workloads. 

-   Limits the number of discrete mapped memory areas. 

-   Maximum number of packets to put in the queue before delivery to the upper layer. 

-   Increase the maximum connections. 

-   Define the port range available for a new connection. 

-   The maximum amount of option memory buffers. 

-   The default and maximum amount for the receive and send socket memory. 

-   Minimum, average, and maximum size of the TCP read and send buffers.
