### Monitor SafeSquid health

SafeSquid Dashboard displays the status of each modular function, integration, and database, and enables administrators to analyse the performance of your secure web gateway.

### [Generate performance plots](/docs/13-System%20Audit/Performance%20Plot.md)

To visualise performance metrics, administrators can also generate performance plots.


### Configure logging

SafeSquid has customisable logging options for diverse usage analytics, debugging, and performance validation equirements. SafeSquid's Open Format logs are human-readable, and structured for programmatic analysis using elementary tools. Logs are also streamed to the product interface for quick impact analysis of configuration changes.

### [Analyse the SafeSquid Logs](/docs/13-System%20Audit/Security%20Logs.md)

SafeSquid application logs are stored in plain text form under the **/var/log/safesquid** directory. A comprehensive set of logging modules offers advanced forensic capabilities for enhanced network security and usage analysis.

### Manage log storage

SafeSquid logs are automatically time-stamped, and the latest log file is rotated. For reducing footprint, SafeSquid has configurable options for compressing log files and scavenging old data.
