# Monit

Monit continually monitors and optimises the system to ensure zero downtime and optimal performance. In the event of unexpected shutdowns or system failures, Monit restarts the SafeSquid service. Furthermore, Monit continuously optimises the processes and actively cleans up unnecessary or temporary files. Additionally, Monit fetches real-time threat intelligence updates. Whenever software upgrades are dropped in SafeSquid Interface, Monit upgrades SafeSquid on restart.
