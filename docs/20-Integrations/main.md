# Integrate SafeSquid with IAM and VPN

SafeSquid integrates with enterprise identity management and VPN infrastructure so policy enforcement and authentication align with existing systems. This section links to Identity and Access Management (IAM) and VPN integration documentation.

## Integration guides

### [Identity and Access Management](01-Identity_and_Access_Management/main.md)
Organizations require integration with existing identity management to enforce user-based policies and centralized authentication. Identity and Access Management describes directory services and SSO integration (Active Directory, OpenLDAP) with SafeSquid. Consistent access control and audit attribution rely on this integration. Follow the document and Authentication → Directory Services for detailed setup.

### [VPN Integration](02-VPN/main.md)
Remote users and branch offices need consistent web security policy enforcement across distributed infrastructure. VPN Integration enables SafeSquid to use WireGuard for encrypted tunnels and centralized policy enforcement. Secure remote access and consistent security posture result from this integration. Configure VPN integration through SafeSquid network settings using this document.
