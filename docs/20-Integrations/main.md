# Integrations Overview

## Enterprise-ready architecture enables security integration

SafeSquid's integration framework provides connectivity with enterprise identity management systems, VPN infrastructure, and third-party security solutions through standardized protocols and flexible configuration options. The system supports seamless integration with Active Directory, OpenLDAP, SIEM platforms, DLP systems, and threat intelligence feeds to create unified security ecosystems. This enterprise-grade integration capability ensures SafeSquid operates as a cohesive component within existing security infrastructure while maintaining centralized management and policy enforcement.

## Identity-Driven Security Replaces Isolated Proxy Controls

Legacy proxy solutions operate as isolated security components without integration into enterprise identity management systems, creating policy enforcement gaps and administrative complexity. SafeSquid's integration framework establishes identity as the foundation for all security decisions through connectivity with directory services, single sign-on systems, and identity providers. This identity-driven approach ensures consistent policy enforcement across all security layers while reducing administrative overhead and improving user experience through unified authentication mechanisms.

## Identity and Access Management Integration

Organizations require integration with existing identity management systems to enforce user-based policies, maintain centralized authentication, and ensure consistent access control across all security layers. Identity and Access Management integration enables SafeSquid to authenticate users through enterprise directory services, implement single sign-on capabilities, and enforce identity-based policies through standardized protocols and flexible configuration options. This integration capability ensures SafeSquid operates as an integrated component within enterprise identity ecosystems while maintaining security boundaries and policy consistency.

### Identity and Access Management: [Identity and Access Management](01-Identity_and_Access_Management/main.md)
Configure directory services and SSO (Active Directory, OpenLDAP) for enterprise-grade identity management and policy enforcement. The document links to [Authentication → Directory Services](/docs/Authentication/Directory%20Services/main) for detailed setup.

## Secure Connectivity and Remote Access

### VPN integration: [VPN Integration](02-VPN/main.md)
Organizations require secure connectivity between remote users, branch offices, and cloud environments to enable consistent web security policy enforcement across distributed infrastructure. VPN Integration enables SafeSquid to establish encrypted tunnels using WireGuard technology, providing secure transport for web traffic while maintaining centralized policy enforcement and threat protection. This integration capability ensures consistent security posture across all network segments while enabling flexible deployment models and secure remote access. Configure VPN integration through SafeSquid's network settings to enable secure connectivity and centralized policy enforcement across distributed environments.
