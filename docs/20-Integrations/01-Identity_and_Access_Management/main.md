# Enforce identity-driven policy via directory and SSO

SafeSquid integrates with enterprise identity and access management (IAM) systems to enforce user-based and group-based policies. Identity comes from directory services and single sign-on; policy enforcement uses that identity for access restriction, logging, and reporting.

## IAM integration guides

Identity and Access Management configuration in SafeSquid is implemented through **Authentication** and **Directory Services**. For setup and procedures, use the following:

### [Directory Services](../../04-Authentication/03-Directory_Services/main.md)
Identity-driven policy requires centralized user authentication and group membership. Directory Services covers Active Directory and OpenLDAP integration for simple and SSO authentication. Configure directory services there and reference those identities in SafeSquid access restriction and reporting. Use the Directory Services section and the Active Directory and OpenLDAP subsections for setup.
