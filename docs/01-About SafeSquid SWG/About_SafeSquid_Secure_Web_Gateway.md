# About SafeSquid Web Gateway

## Background

Right since its very birth, WWW challenged enterprises with productivity losses.
Internet-based services for disseminating user-generated content like social networks, file sharing, etc. offer new avenues for the loss of confidential data and information.

The profitability of targeted advertising incentivizes Social Networking and e-commerce giants to innovate privacy-breaching technologies.

A multitude of web developers, inadvertently adopt free software components that disguise malware, making visitors vulnerable to financial and identity attacks.

The rising popularity of Internet-based banking services motivates cyber-criminals to increase Phishing efforts.

SaaS-based revenue models of sophisticated Ransomware and Botnet services on the dark web, demand very basic skills to launch lucrative cyber-crime start-ups.

The race to excite users with innovative applications beget the "deliver first and fix later" culture, consistently betrays users to new zero-day vulnerabilities.

Heralding the information age, the WWW is the primary driver of enterprise knowledge quotient and key to enhancing business efficiency.

WWW evolved quite explosively over the last few decades due to the rapid adoption of innovative technologies. General users now enjoy easy-to-use web-based services, delivered by a very complex inter-connect of diverse technologies. Transparency of these technologies, particularly those implemented on Layer 7 / HTTP, makes them also very difficult to comprehend for even an average IT technician, much less anticipate the underlying risks. Thus, Internet enablement though necessary, exposes business establishments to substantial risks.

## Mitigation

Security solutions for mitigating web-based threats are historically as old as the WWW itself. Effective solutions must deliver real-time threat mitigation and require adequate computing power and interaction with remote security validation services.

Use of End Point Security (EPS) solutions such as anti-malware pre-dates the Internet Age. The evolution of EPS solutions over the last couple of decades improved defense against web-based threats.
The host operating system and the application initiating the web traffic limit the effectiveness of EPS. EPS shares a large slice of the computing power and network bandwidth provisioned for the end-point user's routine business functions, thus reducing the individual's efficiency. The difficulty quotient of implementing granular policies to facilitate the business needs of individual users or functional groups rises exponentially as the number of subject endpoints increases. The latency in effecting the security strategies prevents timely corrections and validation of the effectiveness.

Perimeter Security solutions like Network Layer Firewalls (NLF) and Proxy Servers, enable mitigation of threats before they impact an endpoint. NLF scrutinizes traffic Layer 3 and 4 traffic, to prevent connection of enterprise cyber-assets and endpoints to or from undesirable external entities. Proxy Servers are Application Layer Firewalls (ALF) that scrutinize Layer 7 traffic and mitigate exploits in the application protocol. An HTTP Proxy server prevents endpoints from establishing a direct network connection with external web services and inspects web-based traffic to eliminate undesirable exchange information.

The legacy strategy of mitigating web-based threats focussed on blocking access to certain websites, generically termed URL Filtering. Early generations of perimeter solutions could thus deliver both - NLF and ALF requirements.

The evolution of the WWW introduced new capabilities such as user-generated content, multi-media experiences, and seamless interconnect of Layer 7 services from multiple services. Threat mitigation thus requires real-time Deep Inspection of payload and new dimensions presented by continuously evolving HTTP protocols. Rapid adoption of SSL increases the data volume scrutinized by ALF, manifold. The challenge overwhelms the limited computing power of traditional firewalls both volumetrically and subjectively.

## The SafeSquid® approach

Enterprises with high-security awareness employ solutions distinctively specialized for NLF and ALF technologies. As both technologies present different challenges, engaging technicians specializing in relevant skill sets ensures optimal use of both.

Traditional ALF solutions seek to re-purpose legacy web caching proxy technologies. Inherent limitations thus not only restrict security capabilities but also impact performance when multiple security options are enabled.

SafeSquid is a HTTP Proxy Server, specifically designed for Application Layer Security. The purpose-oriented architecture promises scalable performance while ensuring comprehensive mitigation of Layer 7 threats.

Pioneering solutions to mitigate web-based threats, yet unaddressed by alternatives, highlights SafeSquid's evolution since its maiden release in 2004. Collaboration with security specialists, administrators, and vendors worldwide sets the innovation goals.

## What is SafeSquid?

SafeSquid is an RFC 2616 compliant HTTP/1.1 proxy server, specially designed to provide maximum protocol, and payload security.

SafeSquid based Secure Web Gateways enable your users to safely access the web.

SafeSquid, when setup in Reverse Proxy mode, secures your web applications.

SafeSquid is a highly scalable software, that enables scaling up by increasing the hardware provisioning, or scaling out by creating an application cluster.

## Why should I use SafeSquid?

SafeSquid is an HTTP Proxy Server specially designed for web security. You should use SafeSquid for securely distributing Internet access across large network and to protect your enterprise against productivity losses, and collateral losses.

## Which Operating Systems does SafeSquid support?

SafeSquid support both operating systems, i.e. LINUX as well as Microsoft Windows.

The installable packages for both these platforms (LINUX and Microsoft Windows) are different for obvious reasons, the configuration and operation is quite identical. So, you can choose platform of your choice, to host SafeSquid Proxy Service.

Yes, the advantages of deploying SafeSquid on Linux are overall higher because the Linux operating system is better suited for servers. But then if you are more comfortable with Microsoft®Windows, you can happily deploy on Windows. Migration from either of the platforms to the other is not very difficult, really!
