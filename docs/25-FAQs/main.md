## Can I use SafeSquid Captive portal to monitor internet usage traffic?
Yes. SafeSquid captive portal can monitor internet usage traffic.

## What is SafeSquid Captive portal?
SafeSquid captive portal is works as same as general captive portal.

Used to enhance security of WIFI network by authenticating users before granting internet access.

Users receive the SafeSquid Captive Portal landing page when accessing the internet via the WIFI network and enter credentials there.

SafeSquid captive portal validates user credentials using various authentication mechanisms and maintains database of authenticated source IP addresses and usernames for lookup.

If a user from a source IP address authenticated through captive portal, then SafeSquid will pick the username from the database and attach to the traffic coming from the same source IP address

This way SafeSquid captive portal secures WIFI network by only granting access to valid users

Combining SafeSquid Captive Portal with SafeSquid secure web gateway allows monitoring of internet usage, filtering of traffic, and other security enhancements to enhance security levels.

## Does SafeSquid supports transparent proxy?
Yes, SafeSquid supports transparent proxy.

SafeSquid support both HTTP and HTTPS websites in transparent mode. The HTTPS websites in transparent mode called as SSL transparent proxy

The traffic will come to router and router will send traffic to SafeSquid Secure web gate way with port 80 and 443 respectively.

The **redirection rules on SafeSquid Secure web gateway** will redirect traffic to SafeSquid Proxy with port 8080 and 8443 (SSL transparent) respectively (By enabling IP forwarding).

## When to enable WCCP
For transparent redirection of traffic, Load balance traffic & scaling up or Service assurance & high availability, enable WCCP in SafeSquid. Enable WCCP support on routers that support WCCP.

Ex: CISCO ASA routers.

Web Cache Communication Protocol (WCCP) is a Cisco-developed content-routing protocol that provides a mechanism to redirect traffic flows in real-time. It has built-in load balancing, scaling, fault tolerance, and service-assurance (failsafe) mechanisms.

## Preventing access to social networking sites
Yes. SafeSquid can prevent users from accessing social networking sites. When configured, SafeSquid blocks all social networking sites by default. Administrators can allow those sites for specific times (e.g. lunch hour).

Allow social networking sites in lunch hours follow -- [LINK](/docs/Use%20Cases/Allow_Social_Networking_Sites_during_Lunch_Hours)

Facebook is a social networking website that allows users to interact with other users in a multimedia environment on the Web. Facebook users can install and use applications to enhance their experience. Many organizations want to allow Facebook access to maintain morale, increase retention, and boost hiring, but they also want to control access to it.

SafeSquid allows full Facebook access for a social media group, partial access to a customer service group, and read-only access to other groups. Access to Facebook can also assigned by time of day, so permissions could relax during lunch or after business hours. For more details follow - LINK

## Preventing users from uploading confidential data
Yes. SafeSquid can prevent users from uploading confidential data. When an organization has confidential information and an internal user leaks it intentionally or unintentionally, productivity loss can be large.

Data leakage can occur through many channels. Users may upload important documents to the internet; even when content filtering blocks Microsoft Word and Excel files, users can create archives of those files and attempt to upload them. Blocking all archives is not practical because staff use archives to transfer large log files.

There are other users who simply take information out of Microsoft Word and Microsoft XL and simply send an Email to third party.

In modern era, these kind of data leaks become a challenge for organizations. Organizations are in a quest for content filtering software's which can deeply inspect archive files and able to identify whether the archive or emails which contains certain keyword matches.

This challenge is also big for security experts because when there is an upload the post data formation is different for Gmail / Google Drive/ Media fire/ Drobox etc. The wide range of formations of post data made it difficult for security experts to derive concrete solution to these challenges.

But SafeSquid come up with **Advanced DLP** solution embedded into **SafeSquid SWG**, which analyzes post data, deeply inspect archives using file decomposition methods and able to identify whether archive or emails or social media posts contains certain keyword matches. Based on the match, the administrator can block uploads by user or by destination website. The Advanced DLP solution is managed from the SafeSquid Self-Service Portal, where administrators create keyword expression matches. SafeSquid SWG will download those keyword expressions and loads into memory. When an archive uploads or an email write, SafeSquid SWG analyses Post data and transmit it to the Clam AV daemon for Signatures verification. If the keyword expression matches Clam AV daemon responds with match. SafeSquid will take respective action based on match.

## Preventing upload of specific file extensions
Yes. SafeSquid can prevent users from uploading specific file extensions.

SafeSquid DLP section is nothing but **Data Loss Prevention module**, used to protect from sending sensitive or critical information outside the corporate network.

It is possible by blocking the specific file types or file extensions based on Content type and extension of file types.

## Can I prevent users to use anonymous proxy?
Yes you can prevent users from using anonymous proxy using SafeSquid.

An anonymous proxy will allow users to surf the web anonymously, since it tunnels your data through servers that spread out across the globe and involve other IP addresses.

Anonymous Proxy service enhances your security and lets your users access some restricted websites online.

## Should third-party cookies be blocked?
SafeSquid can block cookies for third-party domains. This controls tracking across sites and hides the referrer for third-party domains; SafeSquid can set referrer to match hostname. Administrators can also hide user agents for third-party domains; SafeSquid can use a default user agent (e.g. Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 5.5; Windows 98; Win 9x 4.90)).
