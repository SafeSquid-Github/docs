# How To Use find\_client\_id.sh for Getting Complete Connection Log

## Overview

While troubleshooting, you may want to analyze the connection status right from the beginning, when the connection began, profiles and web category added, headers received/sent by the proxy server, error or warning for the connection, etc.

But getting complete connection details just by navigating native logs is not possible, because the logs are written in real time as the connections are made.

For example, if you are requesting [https://www.google.com](https://www.google.com) and [https://mail.google.com](https://mail.google.com) then log will be not written on the basis of connection, but on the basis of how the endpoint server response, which means you’ll need to hunt for complete connection details.

Getting complete connection log in a corporate network where they have hundreds of users is an impossible task and can lead to incomplete analysis for the problem.

find\_client\_[id.sh](http://id.sh) can be used to get complete connection details.

Using the client id from logs will provide complete connection details.
