## Issues
The company policy is all the websites that come under the social network category are blocked for all employees, but the company wants to whitelist a few social networking websites. We add those websites to the whitelist category but still while accessing showing a block template.

I want to allow our corporate website, so I have done the necessary configuration for whitelisting, but still, our employees are not able to access our corporate website.

Note: Whitelist category means the category that we have to allow. The blacklist category means the category which we have to block.

## Solution
Make sure that the **sscore** section is enabled. And the categorization engine is loaded successfully. You can check this from the SafeSquid Statistics page from the interface.

**You need to add your corporate website to the whitelist category from the Categorize Web-sites section under Custom Settings from SafeSquid UI.**


## Steps

1.  [Access the SafeSquid interface](/docs/08-SafeSquid%20Interface/Accessing%20the%20SafeSquid%20Interface.md)
