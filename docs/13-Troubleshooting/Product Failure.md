## Issues
1.  I uploaded my activation key, but still SafeSquid UI is showing Failed to set Subscription details.
1.  After uploading the activation key, I am getting the template on the browser proxy server refusing connections.
1.  Unable to see subscription details on the support page from SafeSquid User Interface.

## Root Causes

1.  SafeSquid server is unable to contact the SafeSquid Subscription server.
1.  The file (activation key) was not uploaded correctly.
1.  The file name you uploaded is other than **activation_key.**
1.  After uploading the activation key, the page shows the proxy server refusing connections.
1.  SafeSquid service restart was not done properly.

## Troubleshooting
### Case 1: Check for the activation_key file on the SafeSquid server.
Run the below command and check for the file:

```bash
ls -lrt /usr/local/safesquid/security/
```
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  root@dev:~# ls -lrt /usr/local/safesquid/security/
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  total 60

  drwxrwxr-- 2 ssquid root 4096 Jul 10 11:55 dns

  -rw-rw-r-- 1 ssquid root 724 Jul 28 11:23 krb5.conf

  -rw-rw-r-- 1 ssquid root 2111 Aug 3 18:52 activation_key

  drwxrwxr-- 2 ssquid root 12288 Aug 4 16:04 policies

  drwxrwxr-- 5 ssquid root 4096 Aug 4 16:09 ssl

  -rw-rw-r-- 1 ssquid root 15744 Aug 5 09:51 activation_key.updates.backup

  -rw-rw-r-- 1 ssquid root 15744 Aug 5 09:51 activation_key.updates
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

If the file was not found, then upload your activation key again and click on restart

:::note
Restart SafeSquid service from the SafeSquid Interface will work, only if the [monit service](/docs/13-System%20Audit/Monit.md) is configured properly on the SafeSquid server.
:::

Otherwise, you can directly restart the SafeSquid service from LINUX box by using below commands

```bash
/etc/init.d/safesquid stop
```
```bash
/etc/init.d/safesquid start
```
### Case 2: Check the connection to the Subscription server, by using following commands
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  root@dev:~# ping swgupdates2.safesquid.net
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

**After uploading the activation key, the page shows the proxy server refusing connections**

SafeSquid restart was not done, start the SafeSquid from the server console by using the command below:

```bash
/etc/init.d/safesquid start
```
