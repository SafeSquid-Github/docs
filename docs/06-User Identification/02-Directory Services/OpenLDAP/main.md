# Integrate OpenLDAP with SafeSquid

## Overview

Here I am integrating my Active Directory with following information.

**IP Address: 192.168.247.10**

**Domain of Active Directory: safesquid.net**

**Base Dn : dc=safesquid,dc=net**

**User Name: cn=admin,dc=safesquid,dc=net**

See more about [**Integrate LDAP section**](https://help.safesquid.com/portal/en/kb/articles/integrate-ldap), here we explained the working of each field in the Integrate LDAP section.

## Prerequisites

Make sure that all the values (LDAP server FQDN, LDAP server IP, Username, password, base dn, domain ) in configuration are correct. If any value is wrong SafeSquid will fail to fetch the entries.
