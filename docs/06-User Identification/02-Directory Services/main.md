### LDAP Users

You can integrate a LDAP service like OpenLDAP or Microsoft AD to setup Basic Proxy Authentication

The openLDAP service is much simpler to implement and managing the users through LDAPadmin is much easier than the SafeSquid Users and the SafeSquid Linux Machine Users.

Microsoft AD need to up and running on the Windows server and it is also easy to manage through LDAPadmin.

These methods could be used it the number of the users in an organization are roughly around 50-65.

The integration part is a bit tricky but once it is done then there won't be any problem in the future.
