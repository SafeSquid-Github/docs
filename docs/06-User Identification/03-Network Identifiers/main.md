Network Identifiers in **SafeSquid** allow you to configure authentication and access controls based on network characteristics, enhancing security and policy enforcement.

## Included Topics
- [IP-Based Authentication](/docs/06-User%20Identification/03-Network%20Identifiers/IP-Based%20Authentication.md): Configure authentication policies based on client IP addresses.
- [Network Identifiers](/docs/06-User%20Identification/03-Network%20Identifiers/Network%20Identifiers.md): Set up network-based identifiers for access control and traffic management.

These configurations help to restrict or allow access based on network origin, improving granular security policies.
