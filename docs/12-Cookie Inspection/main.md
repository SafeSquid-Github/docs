# Cookie Inspection

## Cookie filter controls which hosts can send and receive cookies

The Cookie Filter lets administrators choose which hosts (websites) may send and receive cookies. An HTTP cookie is a small piece of data sent from a website and stored in the user's browser while the user browses. Administrators can control cookie exchange between remote websites and users, manage user privacy (username and preferences), and prevent users from logging into personal accounts on selected sites.

**Example:** Block cookies from advertising sites such as tribalfusion.com and doubleclick.net to prevent private information from being transferred. Users can query search engines (Google, Yahoo) but cannot log into personal accounts (Gmail, shopping, trading sites).
