## Troubleshooting
The dashboard information is obtained from SafeSquid databases. Some records on dashboard is obtained from Master table, whereas some other records are obtained from non-Master table.

Records that are coming from Master table are displayed quickly, whereas records from non-Master table waits for 1000 transactions.
