## Solution
### Case 1: Facebook accessible via proxy but login fails

When https://www.facebook.com/ is accessible via proxy with HTTPS inspection enabled, HTTPS and SSL certificate configuration in the browser are correct. If HTTPS inspection is not configured, follow [Configure HTTPS Inspection](../05-SSL_Inspection/01-Configure_HTTPS_Inspection.md). Inability to log in on Facebook usually means the Cookie Filter section is enabled with Global TRUE. Set the policy under Privacy Control > Cookie filter > Deny to Enabled FALSE (search for "Strip cookies from all connections profiled as NO LOGIN") and disable it.

### Case 2: Login fails on a specific website using Facebook or Google credentials via proxy

Confirm the target website is HTTP or HTTPS. For HTTPS, configure the HTTPS Inspection section; follow [Configure HTTPS Inspection](../05-SSL_Inspection/01-Configure_HTTPS_Inspection.md). If login to https://stackoverflow.com/ via Facebook or Google fails, the Elevated Privacy section is likely enabled with Global TRUE. Set the policy under Privacy Control > Elevated Privacy > Elevated policies to Enabled FALSE (search for "Blocks the third-party cookies") and disable it.

### Case 3: Facebook login works but Google account login fails

When login works on https://www.facebook.com/ and other sites but fails only on https://accounts.google.com/, the corporate policy under Header Filter > Insert is likely enabled. Set the policy under Privacy Control > Header Filter > Insert to Enabled FALSE (search for "Enforce use of corporate Google Account, for all users who are NOT ALLOWED PERSONAL GOOGLE ACCOUNTS") and disable it.

### Case 4: Login fails on both Google and Facebook

When login fails only on https://accounts.google.com/ and https://www.facebook.com/, the "Block Particular User Login to Facebook or Gmail" policy is likely enabled. Set the policy under Real Time Content Security > Content modifier > Rewrite Policies to Enabled FALSE.

:::note
If the global section is enabled for the particular section but the policy under that particular section is disabled then that individual policy should not work.
