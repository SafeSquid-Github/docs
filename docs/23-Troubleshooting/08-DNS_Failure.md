## Root Causes

1.  The FQDN of the website is incorrect.
1.  The local DNS server service is not running.

## Solution
If the FQDN of the website is incorrect you will face a DNS failure issue to that website while accessing via proxy. So, you have to enter the correct FQDN of that particular website.

If the FQDN of a particular website is correct but the local DNS server service is not running still you can face a DNS failure issue. So, you make sure that the local DNS server service is running.

Run the below commands to verify DNS server service

**nslookup (FQDN of the site)**

example:

**nslookup www.safesquiddns.com**

Server: 127.0.0.1

Address: 127.0.0.1#53

Non-authoritative answer:

www.safesquiddns.com canonical name = safesquiddns.com.

Name: safesquiddns.com

Address: 164.177.149.146

If the website is not able to resolve

root@dev:~# nslookup www.safesquiddns.com

Server: 127.0.0.1

Address: 127.0.0.1#53

server can't find test.safesquiddns.com: NXDOMAIN
