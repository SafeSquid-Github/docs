# Advantages of Custom Categorisation

SafeSquid by default provides some website categories, you can use these categories to block of an inappropriate content.

For example, if you want to block all social networking sites, you can directly choose a category as **socialnetworks** then block the total category.

No need to create a separate category for that.

See All [**default**_categories](https://help.safesquid.com/portal/en/kb/articles/default-categories) present in SafeSquid
