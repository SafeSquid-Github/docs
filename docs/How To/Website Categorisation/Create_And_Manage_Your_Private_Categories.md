# Create And Manage Your Private Categories

## Overview

Custom website categorization in SafeSquid allows you to create your own list of website categories, so that you can easily block or allow list of websites. SafeSquid Web categorization also comes with Some default categories, so that you can use that default categories to block inappropriate content, Phishing, web mails...etc. The features allows you to create categories based on single website as well as Multiple websites.

**Example:**
    In an organization they created the categories same as below.
    Black list category - to block all websites which are not useful for them
    White list category - to allow only limited websites, so that they can save the bandwidth and production
    Bypass SSL category - to bypass HTTPS inspection for trusted and banking websites
    Bypass Authentication category - to bypass Authentication to some of the websites 
    Now they can use these categories in Access Profiles section to allow or block. And in the future also, if the organization decided to add some more websites to black list, then they can easily add that list to Black list without modifying the configuration. You can also create or delete the categories from SafeSquid Self Service portal without any interaction to SafeSquid Web Interface.
