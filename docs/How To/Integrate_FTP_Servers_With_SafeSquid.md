# Integrate FTP Servers with SafeSquid

## Overview

This can be useful when the client (some of the older web-browsers) applications lack the support to directly access FTP sites.

Such Internet Clients may also set SafeSquid as their HTTP/1.1 Proxy to access FTP sites.

The settings made here apply to all requests for ftp:// URLs.
