# Integrate a Linux Host with a Windows AD for Kerberos SSO authentication

## Overview

Kerberos Authentication support is particularly useful for Enterprise networks that have a Microsoft AD based Domain controller. By properly configuring the necessary Kerberos related factors, your enterprise Internet users can optionally enjoy Windows Integrated Authentication. Windows Integrated Authentication is a non-interactive authentication process, that uses SSO authentication. SSO ensures that your users do not have to manually provide their user credentials as username / password to access your networked enterprise resources and services, yet their access is restricted as specified. SSO, thus not only just adds convenience to the overall user experience, but also enhances security.
