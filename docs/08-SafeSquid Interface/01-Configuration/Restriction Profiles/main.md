- [Cookie Filter](/docs/08-SafeSquid%20Interface/01-Configuration/Restriction%20Profiles/Cookie_Filter.md): Configure filters to block or allow cookies for enhanced privacy.
- [Elevated Privacy](/docs/08-SafeSquid%20Interface/01-Configuration/Restriction%20Profiles/Elevated_Privacy.md): Enforce advanced privacy settings, ensuring minimal data collection.
- [Header Filter](/docs/08-SafeSquid%20Interface/01-Configuration/Restriction%20Profiles/Header_Filter.md): Filter and modify HTTP headers to protect user identities and privacy.
- [Speed Limits](/docs/08-SafeSquid%20Interface/01-Configuration/Restriction%20Profiles/Speed_Limits.md): Configure bandwidth and speed restrictions based on user or site criteria.

These profiles provide granular control over user access and privacy while optimizing network traffic.
