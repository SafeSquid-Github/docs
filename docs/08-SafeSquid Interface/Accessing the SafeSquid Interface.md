## Overview

SafeSquid Proxy Service has a browser-based intrinsic WebGUI, that allows users to configure, and manage its various features. To access the Interface, you must configure your web browser to use the SafeSquidÂ® proxy server. You should be able to access the WebGUI with the http://Safesquid.cfg/

## Prerequisites

To access the SafeSquid User Interface, you must configure your web browser to use the SafeSquid proxy server. We recommend you configure SafeSquid Proxy into Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox Browser.
