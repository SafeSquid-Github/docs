## [Access the SafeSquid User Interface](/docs/08-SafeSquid%20Interface/Accessing%20the%20SafeSquid%20Interface.md)
SafeSquid has an intrinsic Web-based UI, that will enable you to manage your instance, configure policies, fine-tune the features, and monitor your secure web gateway. First, create a policy on the top to allow at least one admin account to access the configuration portal to avoid lockout when configuring policies.

## Leverage Proxy Auto-Configuration (PAC)
SafeSquid supports PAC files to enable automatic traffic distribution across proxy clusters.
