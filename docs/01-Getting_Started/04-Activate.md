# Activate Your License

An unlicensed SafeSquid instance cannot use commercial features (threat intelligence, URL categorization, DR backup, support) or receive full update feeds. Activation ties your key to this instance and unlocks the chosen tier so the gateway is fully operational.

## Key Benefits

- **Unlock commercial features** — threat intelligence, URL categorization database, 365-day DR backup, and email support (see table below).
- **Receive updates** — subscription and malware definition feeds require successful activation.
- **Prove licensing for audits** — activation status is visible in the SafeSquid interface for compliance evidence.

SafeSquid offers two licensing tiers:

|  | Free | Commercial |
| -- | :--: | :--: |
| Core proxy and filtering | ✅ | ✅ |
| SSL inspection | ✅ | ✅ |
| Custom policies and profiles | ✅ | ✅ |
| Real-time threat intelligence | ❌ | ✅ |
| URL categorization database | ❌ | ✅ |
| DR backup (365 days) | ❌ | ✅ |
| Email support | ❌ | ✅ |

The free license has no time limit. You can upgrade to commercial at any time through the [Self-Service Portal](https://key.safesquid.com).



## Readiness Checklist

Your SafeSquid server needs outbound access to these endpoints. Ensure your firewall allows the traffic.

## Activation Steps

1. **Configure the browser** to use SafeSquid as the HTTP proxy (SafeSquid IP, port 8080). See [Connect Your Client](/docs/Getting_Started/Connect_Your_Client/main/) if the browser is not yet configured.

2. **Open the SafeSquid interface** by navigating to [http://safesquid.cfg/](http://safesquid.cfg/) in your browser.

   When accessing for the first time, the interface prompts for upload of the activation key.

3. **Select the activation key file** and click **Upload**.

4. **Click Restart** to apply the license.

5. **Verify activation.** After the page reloads, go to **Support** in the menu.

6. **Confirm activation details.** Ensure the **Activation Details** section shows your product type, expiry (if applicable), and subscription status.

:::note
To synchronize SSL certificates and configuration across a proxy cluster, upload the same activation key on every SafeSquid instance.

## Verification and Evidence

After activation and restart, confirm in the SafeSquid interface:

1. In the top menu, go to **Support**.
2. In **Activation Details**, verify:
   - **Product Type** matches your tier (Free or Commercial)
   - **Status** shows active
   - **Expiry** is in the future (commercial) or shows no expiry (free)

Use this screen for auditor requests or compliance evidence that the gateway is correctly licensed.

## Troubleshooting

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="case1" label="Key Not Detected" default>

**Symptom:** After uploading, the interface shows "Failed to set Subscription details."

**Cause:** The activation key file is missing or misnamed.

**Fix:**

1. Verify the key file exists:

   ```bash
   ls -lrt /usr/local/safesquid/security/
   ```

   Look for a file named `activation_key`.

2. If missing, re-upload the key through the interface.

3. Restart SafeSquid:

   ```bash
   /etc/init.d/safesquid stop
   /etc/init.d/safesquid start
   ```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="case2" label="Server Unreachable">

**Symptom:** After uploading the key, the browser shows "proxy server refusing connections."

**Cause:** SafeSquid cannot reach the subscription server.

**Fix:**

1. Test connectivity:

   ```bash
   ping swgupdates2.safesquid.net
   nslookup swgupdates2.safesquid.net
   ```

2. If DNS or connectivity fails, check firewall rules against the endpoint tables above.

3. Restart after fixing:

   ```bash
   /etc/init.d/safesquid start
   ```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="case3" label="Service Not Restarted">

**Symptom:** Subscription details remain empty after uploading the key, or the browser shows the proxy is refusing connections.

**Cause:** SafeSquid was not restarted after the key upload.

**Fix:**

1. If Monit is configured, it should restart SafeSquid automatically. Otherwise, restart manually:

   ```bash
   /etc/init.d/safesquid stop
   /etc/init.d/safesquid start
   ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Next steps

1. [Connect Your Client](/docs/Getting_Started/Connect_Your_Client/main/) — configure at least one browser or client to use the proxy.
2. [Verify Your Setup](/docs/Getting_Started/Verify_Your_Setup/) — run smoke tests to confirm the proxy is receiving traffic.
