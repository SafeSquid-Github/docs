# Getting Started

## [What is SafeSquid SWG?](/docs/SafeSquid_SWG/main/)

SafeSquid SWG (Secure Web Gateway) is the full product: proxy, policy console, reporting, and DNS security. SafeSquid is a multi-threaded HTTP Proxy Server, specially designed for Layer 7 Perimeter Security. Zero Trust Web Security architecture delivers scalable performance while ensuring comprehensive mitigation of Layer 7 threats.

*SafeSquid SWG: proxy layer, policy and configuration, reporting, and DNS security.*

SafeSquid SWG enforces granular web access control, deep content mitigation, and real-time visibility in enterprise web traffic.

Follow the sequence below to reach a working pilot: sizing and registration, installation, license activation, and client connectivity. By the end you will have a deployed SafeSquid node, an active license, and clients sending web traffic through the proxy.

:::info Before you start

You'll need:
- A server or VM with minimum 4 CPU cores, 8 GB RAM, and 2 network interfaces (one for WAN, one for LAN, or bonded for high availability)
- Internet connectivity for downloads and license activation
- A browser on a machine that can reach the server (for admin access)
- Firewall configured to allow proxy traffic on port 8080 (HTTP) and 8443 (HTTPS admin interface)

After registration, you download an activation key; the gateway becomes fully operational once the key is uploaded and verified.

## Pilot Deployment in 5 Steps

### [Deployment Planning](/docs/Getting_Started/Deployment_Planning/)

SafeSquid is platform-agnostic: single node, HA (active-passive or active-active), cloud VMs, or existing Linux hosts. The deployment guide covers sizing, hardware matrix, network bonding, and disaster recovery. Start with a single node for pilot; plan HA and DR before production.

### [Register and get your key](/docs/Getting_Started/Register/) 

Register on the [SafeSquid Self Service portal](https://key.safesquid.com) and download the activation key.

### [Install SafeSquid](/docs/Getting_Started/Install_SafeSquid/main/)

SafeSquid can be installed via Appliance Builder ISO (SAB), cloud image, or as a TAR package. **SAB (Recommended)** for new bare metal or VM; **Cloud** for AWS, Azure, DigitalOcean, or private cloud; **Linux TAR** for an existing Linux server where you add SafeSquid only.

### [Activate Your License](/docs/Getting_Started/Activate/)

Upload the activation key in the SafeSquid Interface (accessible at `https://safesquid.cfg` once client proxy is configured, or directly via `https://YOUR-SERVER-IP:8443` before proxy setup). The gateway is fully operational only after license verification.

### [Connect Your Client](/docs/Getting_Started/Connect_Your_Client/main/) 

Clients can be configured to use the proxy via browser settings, a PAC (Proxy Auto-Configuration) file, or system-wide proxy settings pushed via MDM or GPO. For the fastest pilot check, configure explicit proxy on one browser, then [Verify Your Setup](/docs/Getting_Started/Verify_Your_Setup/).

## [Troubleshooting](/docs/Troubleshooting/main/)

If the UI doesn't load, activation fails, or clients can't reach the proxy, see the Troubleshooting section for logs and common fixes.

## Next Steps

We recommend configuring security policies in order — each builds on the previous:

1. **[SSL Inspection](/docs/SSL_Inspection/main/)** — Most web traffic is encrypted. Enable SSL Inspection so SafeSquid can actually see and filter HTTPS content.

2. **[Authentication](/docs/Authentication/main/)** — Combine Active Directory user groups with network-based signatures for multi-factor authentication.

3. **[Integrated DNS Security](/docs/DNS_Security/main/)** — Block malicious DNS queries, enforce policy-aware resolution, and mitigate DNS tunneling.

4. **[Profiling Engine](/docs/Profiling_Engine/main/)** — Profile requests by identity, application, content, and time so policies apply to the right traffic.

5. **[Access Restriction](/docs/Access_Restriction/main/)** — Define access control rules by URL category, application, user, and time window.

6. **[Malware Scanners](/docs/Malware_Scanners/main/)** — Scan downloads and content streams for malicious payloads.

7. **[Data Leakage Prevention](/docs/Data_Leakage_Prevention/main/)** — Prevent sensitive data exfiltration in uploads, downloads, and web posts using compliance templates and content rules.

### Production Deployment

When moving to production:
- Push client configuration to all endpoints using PAC files, system-wide proxy settings, GPO, or MDM
- Deploy SafeSquid in a cluster for high availability (active-passive or active-active)
- Configure traffic forensics, usage reports, and real-time dashboards for visibility and compliance
- Integrate with existing IAM, SIEM, and threat intelligence platforms
