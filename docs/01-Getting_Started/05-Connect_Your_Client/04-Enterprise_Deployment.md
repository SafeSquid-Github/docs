## Call to Action

### Windows Enterprise Deployment

#### Group Policy Objects (GPO) Configuration

**Create Proxy Configuration GPO**:
1. Open Group Policy Management Console
2. Create new GPO: "SafeSquid Proxy Configuration"
3. Navigate to Computer Configuration → Policies → Administrative Templates → Windows Components → Internet Explorer
4. Configure "Use automatic configuration script"
5. Enter PAC file URL: `http://pac-server.company.com/proxy.pac`
6. Configure "Disable changing proxy settings" to prevent user modification
7. Link GPO to appropriate Organizational Units

**Registry-Based GPO Configuration**:
1. Navigate to Computer Configuration → Preferences → Windows Settings → Registry
2. Create registry preference items:
   - ProxyEnable: DWORD = 1
   - ProxyServer: String = "192.168.1.100:8080"
   - ProxyOverride: String = "*.local;*.company.com;127.0.0.1"
3. Configure registry path: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings
4. Apply GPO to target Organizational Units

#### Active Directory Integration

**Deploy PAC File via GPO**:
1. Create shared folder for PAC files: `\\domain.com\NETLOGON\PAC\`
2. Copy PAC file to shared location
3. Create GPO to configure PAC file URL
4. Configure PAC file permissions for domain users
5. Deploy GPO to target Organizational Units

**User-Based vs Computer-Based Policies**:
1. **Computer-Based**: Apply proxy settings to all users on specific computers
2. **User-Based**: Apply proxy settings to specific users regardless of computer
3. Configure appropriate policy scope based on organizational requirements

#### Advanced GPO Configuration

**Environment-Specific Configuration**:
1. Create separate GPOs for different environments:
   - Corporate Network GPO
   - Remote Access GPO
   - Guest Network GPO
2. Configure conditional proxy settings based on network location
3. Use WMI filters to apply policies based on system characteristics

**Security Configuration**:
1. Configure "Disable changing proxy settings" to prevent user modification
2. Enable "Disable Internet Options" to prevent proxy bypass
3. Configure "Disable changing connection settings" for additional security

### Linux Enterprise Deployment

#### Puppet Configuration Management

**Puppet Proxy Configuration**:
1. Create Puppet manifest for proxy configuration:
```puppet
class safesquid_proxy {
  file { '/etc/environment':
    ensure  => present,
    content => template('safesquid_proxy/environment.erb'),
  }

  file { '/etc/profile.d/proxy.sh':
    ensure  => present,
    content => template('safesquid_proxy/proxy.sh.erb'),
    mode    => '0644',
  }
}
```

2. Create template files for proxy configuration
3. Apply Puppet configuration to target nodes
4. Monitor configuration compliance and updates

#### Ansible Configuration Management

**Ansible Proxy Playbook**:
1. Create Ansible playbook for proxy configuration:
```yaml
---
- name: Configure SafeSquid Proxy
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Configure system proxy environment
      lineinfile:
        path: /etc/environment
        line: "{{ item }}"
      with_items:
        - "http_proxy=http://192.168.1.100:8080"
        - "https_proxy=http://192.168.1.100:8443"
        - "no_proxy=localhost,127.0.0.1,*.local"

    - name: Configure APT proxy
      lineinfile:
        path: /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/95proxies
        line: "{{ item }}"
      with_items:
        - "Acquire::http::Proxy \"http://192.168.1.100:8080\";"
        - "Acquire::https::Proxy \"http://192.168.1.100:8443\";"
```

2. Execute Ansible playbook on target systems
3. Verify configuration deployment and compliance

#### System-Wide Configuration Management

**Profile.d Scripts Deployment**:
1. Create centralized proxy configuration script
2. Deploy script to `/etc/profile.d/proxy.sh` on all systems
3. Configure script permissions and execution
4. Test script execution and proxy configuration

**Network Manager Configuration**:
1. Create Network Manager configuration templates
2. Deploy configuration via configuration management tools
3. Configure automatic proxy detection and configuration
4. Monitor configuration compliance across systems

### Configuration Management Best Practices

#### Centralized PAC File Hosting

2. Implement version control for PAC file changes
3. Configure automatic PAC file updates and rollback capabilities
4. Monitor PAC file accessibility and performance

**PAC File Distribution**:
1. Use CDN or load balancer for PAC file distribution
2. Implement caching for improved performance
3. Configure monitoring for PAC file availability
4. Test PAC file updates in staging environment before production deployment

#### Automated Updates and Rollback

**Configuration Update Process**:
1. Implement staged deployment process for configuration changes
2. Test configuration changes in isolated environment
3. Deploy changes to pilot group before full deployment
4. Monitor configuration compliance and performance

**Rollback Procedures**:
1. Maintain previous configuration versions for rollback capability
2. Implement automated rollback triggers for configuration failures
3. Document rollback procedures and responsibilities
4. Test rollback procedures in non-production environment

#### Monitoring and Compliance

**Configuration Monitoring**:
1. Implement monitoring for proxy configuration compliance
2. Monitor proxy connectivity and performance across endpoints
3. Configure alerts for configuration failures or compliance violations
4. Generate compliance reports for management review
