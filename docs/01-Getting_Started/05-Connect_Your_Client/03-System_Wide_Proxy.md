# System-Wide Proxy Settings



## Problem Statement

Organizations require operating system-level proxy configuration to ensure all applications route traffic through SafeSquid without individual application configuration for comprehensive security coverage. Many applications do not respect browser-specific proxy settings, requiring system-wide configuration to ensure complete traffic interception and security enforcement. System-wide proxy settings provide universal application coverage while eliminating the need for application-specific configuration across diverse software environments.



## Key Benefits

**Universal Application Coverage**: System-wide proxy configuration ensures all network applications route traffic through SafeSquid, providing comprehensive security coverage without individual application configuration requirements. This universal approach eliminates security gaps caused by applications that bypass browser-specific proxy settings.

**Simplified Management**: OS-level proxy configuration reduces administrative overhead by eliminating the need to configure proxy settings for each individual application. This centralized approach enables consistent security policy enforcement across all network applications.

**Consistent Security Enforcement**: System-wide proxy settings ensure uniform security policy application across all applications, preventing security bypasses and ensuring comprehensive threat protection and policy enforcement.



## Prerequisites

**Client-Side Preparations**: Ensure administrative privileges are available for system-wide proxy configuration changes. Verify network connectivity between client systems and SafeSquid proxy servers with appropriate firewall rules configured.

**SafeSquid-Side Setup**: Configure SafeSquid proxy services on standard ports with proper authentication and policy configuration. Ensure SSL inspection is enabled if HTTPS traffic requires inspection and monitoring.

**System Requirements**: Client systems must have appropriate operating system versions that support system-wide proxy configuration. Network connectivity must be established between client systems and SafeSquid proxy servers.

## Verification and Evidence

**System-Wide Application Testing**: Verify all applications (browsers, email clients, development tools) route traffic through SafeSquid proxy without individual configuration.

**Traffic Monitoring**: Monitor SafeSquid logs to confirm all application traffic is being processed through proxy with appropriate policy enforcement.

**Bypass List Verification**: Test internal domain access to ensure bypass list configuration works correctly for internal resources.

**Performance Validation**: Test application performance to ensure system-wide proxy configuration does not significantly impact functionality or user experience.



## Troubleshooting Guide

**Applications Not Using Proxy**: Verify system-wide proxy settings are properly applied and applications are restarted after configuration changes. Check application-specific proxy settings that may override system settings.

**Connection Refused Errors**: Verify SafeSquid proxy service is running and accessible on configured ports. Check firewall rules and network connectivity.

**Authentication Failures**: Confirm SafeSquid authentication settings match system configuration. Verify user credentials and authentication method compatibility.

**SSL Certificate Issues**: Install SafeSquid root CA certificate in system trust store when SSL inspection is enabled. Verify certificate installation and trust settings.

**Environment Variable Issues**: Check environment variable configuration and ensure variables are properly exported and sourced in application environments.

**Network Manager Conflicts**: Verify Network Manager proxy settings do not conflict with manual environment variable configuration. Choose one configuration method consistently.
