## About Your Activation Key

- **Validity:** The key does not expire. You can use it to activate SafeSquid instances at any time.
- **Reusability:** One key can activate multiple SafeSquid nodes in your deployment (use the same key for HA clusters).
- **Re-download:** Sign in to the [Self-Service Portal](https://key.safesquid.com) anytime to download your key again if lost.
- **File integrity:** Do not rename or modify the `activation_key` file — SafeSquid will reject tampered keys.

## Troubleshooting

Most registration issues resolve by checking spam filters or trying a different browser. If problems persist, contact support with your registered email address.

**Common issues:**

- **Activation email not received?** — Check spam/junk folder. Wait 5 minutes, then try registering again with the same email (duplicate attempts are safe). Still missing? [Contact SafeSquid support](https://www.safesquid.com/contact-us).
- **Key download fails?** — Ensure you are signed in to the [Self-Service Portal](https://key.safesquid.com). Try a different browser or clear your cache. If the issue persists, [contact us](https://www.safesquid.com/contact-us).
- **Forgot your password?** — Use the password reset link on the [Self-Service Portal](https://key.safesquid.com) login page.
