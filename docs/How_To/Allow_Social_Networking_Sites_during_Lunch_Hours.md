## Overview

Most network administrators can access and track anything employees do on their computers. Most of the employees waste their time on social network sites. This can damage not only employment status but employee's reputation also. In most organizations to limit the distraction employers choose to block social media access for the employees. Many organizations/companies prohibit access to social networking sites on their network computers because they believe such access leads to decreased productivity. Nowadays social media is an addiction, which can consume unproductive time of employees.

But nowadays some organization wants their employee to be happy and want to give some privileges and benefits to some or all of the employees. It is possible to allow social media at work with boundaries that satisfy both the employee and employer. So, they make policies such that social networking sites are allowed to be accessed during lunch hours.
