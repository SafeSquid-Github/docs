# Generation of Support tarball

## Problem

Bob is facing some issues while configuring policies on SafeSquid SWG. Also, he found crash while doing the same.

## Benefits

Network related issue or issue related policy configuration can be rectified by generating support tarball. It requires SafeSquid logs, Section information, System logs, Config.xml file, Disk Usage information inside filesystem.txt file, iptable rules if any, network setting inside network.txt file, etc.

You can also take backup of your existing configuration by generating a support tarball through SafeSquid interface.
