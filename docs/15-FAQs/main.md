You cannot simply block archives in your organization because there are people who simply use archive to transfer log files of large sizes.

There are other users who simply take information out of Microsoft Word and Microsoft XL and simply send an Email to third party.

In modern era, these kind of data leaks become a challenge for organizations. Organizations are in a quest for content filtering software's which can deeply inspect archive files and able to identify whether the archive or emails which contains certain keyword matches.

This challenge is also big for security experts because when there is an upload the post data formation is different for Gmail / Google Drive/ Media fire/ Drobox etc. The wide range of formations of post data made it difficult for security experts to derive concrete solution to these challenges.

But SafeSquid come up with **Advanced DLP** solution embedded into **SafeSquid SWG**, which analyses post data, deeply inspect archives using file decomposition methods and able to identify whether archive or emails or social media posts contains certain keyword matches. Based on the match you can take effective actions like block upload if user is so and so or block if the destination website is so and so.

The Advanced DLP solution can managed from SafeSquid Self Service portal there you can create various keyword expression matches. SafeSquid SWG will download those keyword expressions and loads into memory. When an archive uploads or an email write, SafeSquid SWG analyses Post data and transmit it to the Clam AV daemon for Signatures verification. If the keyword expression matches Clam AV daemon responds with match. SafeSquid will take respective action based on match.
