## Category Editor manages website categorization

Use Categorize Websites to manage web-site categorization. Review and modify the categorization of any website. Create new categories and associate websites with them. To modify a website's categorization, use the search box first to view its existing categorization. The interface shows the total number of categories, last updated, and last changed.
