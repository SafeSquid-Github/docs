# Filter inappropriate content with categorization and analyzers



## Content analysis and inappropriate content blocking

SafeSquid prevents users from accessing inappropriate content such as pornography using categorization, image analysis, and text analysis.



## Prerequisites
HTTPS Inspection must be enabled in SafeSquid. See [How to enable HTTPS Inspection](/docs/SSL_Inspection/main/) if not yet enabled.



## Select the Filters to block
To block inappropriate content from web, SafeSquid provides different types of filters.

If know the domains then you can use **custom categorization** to block all websites.

If you want to block pornographic images, you can use image filter.

If you want to block pornographic content, you can use text analyzer.

SafeSquid provides you with some default rules in "Text analyzer" to block pornographic content from web.

And in image filter also there is one default policy exist, to block the pornographic images.



## Custom Categorization
SafeSquid includes sample policies to support policy creation.

Click on 'Configuration' which is at top right of the SafeSquid Interface.

In SafeSquid sample policies " Inappropriate content Strictly block for all users" policy is already present. Enable the relevant policies so they apply.

The page shows existing policies. Search for 'GLOBAL BLOCK'.
