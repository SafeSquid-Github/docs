### Enabled
Enable or Disable this Policy.

-   **TRUE**: Enable this entry

### Comment
For documentation and future references, explain the relevance of this entry to the deployment policies.

That is, by reading the policies, a future user can understand the purpose of that entry.

### Bypass Image Scanning
Enable or disable bypass image filter scanning.

-   **TRUE**: Enable bypass image scanning if you want this entry to be applied for image scanning
-   **FALSE**: Disable bypass image scanning if you do not want this entry to be applied for image scanning

### Profiles
Specify the Profiles applicable for this entry.

This entry will be applicable only if the connection has any one of the specified profiles.

Leave it Blank, to apply for all connections irrespective of any applied profile.

To avoid application to a connection that has a profile, use a negated profile (!profile).

### Threshold
Specify the threshold score to block images.

Images are given scores by analysing the graphical content of an image, in real time.

-10.0 is unlikely to be porn, 0 is very likely.

Images are blocked based on the threshold score.

### Template
Specify the template to replace when this entry is matched.

Templates are used throughout Safesquid as a replacement for pages which can't be displayed due to filtering, error, or other conditions.

Specify the template name that should be displayed on a user's screen when this entry matches.

The name should be selected from template section. Find the template name in the template section.

The default template replaces the blocked image with a checkered box.

### Debug
Enable to just debug, without blocking.

-   **TRUE**: Do not block, just blur the image if possibly pornographic
-   **FALSE**: Block images if score is higher than threshold

## Example
### Rule#1
Bypass image filtering for the marketing team. The marketing team uses social media for digital marketing; create a "Bypass image filtering" profile and an access policy that bypasses the image filter for that group. General rules still apply (adult and blacklisted sites remain blocked).

### Rule#2
Use enhanced image scanning for connections with profile "ENFORCE PARANOID IMAGE SCAN".

Threshold for image scanning is set to -1.0, which will block images where the skin exposure is even slightest compared with the score 0.0.

### Rule#3
For profile "IMAGE ANALYZER DEBUG", render the score for each scanned image without blurring. This helps understand how image scanning works.

### Rule#4
Apply a standard image scanning rule to every connection. Adult images are blocked. Blocked images render as blurred.
