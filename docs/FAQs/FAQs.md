## What is an SSL certificate?

SSL Certificates are small data files that digitally bind a cryptographic key to an organization's details.

When installed on a web server, it activates the padlock and the https protocol and allows secure connections from a web server to a browser.

SSL Certificates provide secure, encrypted communications between a website and an internet browser.

SSL stands for Secure Sockets Layer, the protocol which provides the encryption.

SSL Certificates installed on pages that require end-users to submit sensitive information over the internet like credit card details or passwords.

## Where can I get an SSL certificate?

Microsoft's Active Directory, and OpenLDAP based various Directory Services are extremely popular for setting up a centralized user identity management system.

A Web Gateway when integrated to a Directory Service, can:

Authenticate the users, based on their Directory Service Credentials,

Control their access to the web depending upon their enterprise role and hierarchy,

Log and report their activity, in a manner that the HR managers can analyse internet usage individually and of groups of people.

## What is SafeSquid SSO Authentication?

SafeSquid SSO authentication is non-interactive authentication process.

SafeSquid SSO Authentication support is particularly useful for Enterprise networks that have a Microsoft AD based Domain controller.

By properly configuring the necessary Kerberos related factors with SafeSquid, your enterprise Internet users can enjoy SSO Authentication.

SafeSquid SSO authentication ensures that your users do not have to manually provide their user credentials as username / password to access your networked enterprise resources and services, yet their access restricted as specified. SafeSquid SSO authentication, thus not only just adds convenience to the overall user experience, but also enhances security.

## If my SSO authentication fails is LDAP fail over functionality available in SafeSquid?

If user unable to get access for network enterprise in case, user should not face any problem of authentication because SafeSquid gives you a fantastic functionality known as LDAP fail-over.

If user face any issue while SSO authentication he/she should give LDAP valid credentials i.e. Username and Password.

Once username and password validated user should get access for network enterprise.

## When should I bypass authentication?

Certain applications (like Dropbox) which does not support proxy authentication, they want to bypass authentication for that application.

## Can I use SafeSquid Captive portal to monitor internet usage traffic?

Yes, you can use SafeSquid captive portal to monitor internet usage traffic.

## What is SafeSquid Captive portal?

SafeSquid captive portal is works as same as general captive portal.

Used to enhance security of WIFI network by authenticating users before granting internet access.

Users will receive SafeSquid captive portal landing page when they try to access internet access via WIFI network. Users will punch in credentials.

SafeSquid captive portal validates user credentials using various authentication mechanisms and maintains database of authenticated source IP addresses and usernames for lookup.

If a user from a source IP address authenticated through captive portal, then SafeSquid will pick the username from the database and attach to the traffic coming from the same source IP address

This way SafeSquid captive portal secures WIFI network by only granting access to valid users

Combining SafeSquid Captive Portal with SafeSquid secure web gateway will allow you to monitor internet usage, allow you to filter traffic and do many more things to enhance security levels.

## Does SafeSquid supports transparent proxy?

Yes, SafeSquid supports transparent proxy.

SafeSquid support both HTTP and HTTPS websites in transparent mode. The HTTPS websites in transparent mode called as SSL transparent proxy

The traffic will come to router and router will send traffic to SafeSquid Secure web gate way with port 80 and 443 respectively.

The **redirection rules on SafeSquid Secure web gateway** will redirect traffic to SafeSquid Proxy with port 8080 and 8443 (SSL transparent) respectively (By enabling IP forwarding).

## IPV6?

## Why should I enable WCCP?

## Can I prevent users to upload confidential data?

Yes, you can prevents users from uploading confidential data using SafeSquid.

When you have confidential information in your organization and someone from internal users just leaked the information intentionally or unintentionally, then what will happen? Huge productivity loss.

There are various mediums for data leakage. Users can upload important document to internet, even though your content filtering software does not allow users to upload Microsoft Word and Microsoft XL files, users can act smart and creates an archive using those files and tries to upload achieved files. You cannot simply block archives in your organization because there are people who simply use archive to transfer log files of large sizes.

There are other users who simply take information out of Microsoft Word and Microsoft XL and simply send an Email to third party.

In modern era, these kind of data leaks become a challenge for organizations. Organizations are in a quest for content filtering software's which can deeply inspect archive files and able to identify whether the archive or emails which contains certain keyword matches.

This challenge is also big for security experts because when there is an upload the post data formation is different for Gmail / Google Drive/ Media fire/ Drobox etc. The wide range of formations of post data made it difficult for security experts to derive concrete solution to these challenges.

But SafeSquid come up with **Advanced DLP** solution embedded into **SafeSquid SWG**, which analyses post data, deeply inspect archives using file decomposition methods and able to identify whether archive or emails or social media posts contains certain keyword matches. Based on the match you can take effective actions like block upload if user is so and so or block if the destination website is so and so.

The Advanced DLP solution can managed from SafeSquid Self Service portal there you can create various keyword expression matches. SafeSquid SWG will download those keyword expressions and loads into memory. When an archive uploads or an email write, SafeSquid SWG analyses Post data and transmit it to the Clam AV daemon for Signatures verification. If the keyword expression matches Clam AV daemon responds with match. SafeSquid will take respective action based on match.
