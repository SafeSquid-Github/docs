## Overview

Prevent users to access specific YouTube Channel like 'T-Series'.

**Note:** Blocking of Specific YouTube channel and allowing all the other YouTube videos is a hypothetical scenario. YouTube website is not designed for such hypothetical situation. However, this how-to will demonstrate to block a specific YouTube Channel and one of its playlist videos.

## Prerequisites

HTTPS Inspection should be enabled in SafeSquid. If not enabled, you can check our document - [How to enable HTTPS Inspection.](/docs/07-SSL%20Inspection/Setup%20SSL%20Inspection.md)

You need the YouTube **Channel-ID** and **List-ID**. You have to extract Channel-ID and List-ID from YouTube URL before creating rules in SafeSquid.

## Policy Creation

We can achieve the above by following steps --

### Extract Channel-ID from YouTube Channel

1. Open the YouTube channel you want to block. Here T-Series channel is taken as an example.

Here you will get Channel-ID from the referrer URL. **Channel-ID** is the preceding portion of the URL after **'channel/**' part. Save this part on notepad for reference.

T-Series Channel URL: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCq-Fj5jknLsUf-MWSy4_brA

**Channel-ID: UCq-Fj5jknLsUf-MWSy4_brA**

For **List-ID** extraction click on **PLAY ALL** link on the page as shown below.

### Extract List-ID from YouTube Channel

2. Extract **List-ID** from any of the subsequent URL.

**List-ID** is the preceding portion of the URL after **'&list=**' part. Save this part on notepad for reference.

T-Series Channel subsequent URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IgKdXLfxgQQ&list=PL9bw4S5ePsEE2KMw53rY40A00t4I-otqy

**List-ID: PL9bw4S5ePsEE2KMw53rY40A00t4I-otqy**

You will find every Video in the list contain List-ID of the channel.
