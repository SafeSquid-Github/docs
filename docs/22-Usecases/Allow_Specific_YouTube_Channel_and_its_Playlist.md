## Client Scenario

Ganpat University provides graduate programs to various colleges. Ganpat University distributes the internet to its students. Ganpat University wants to block entire www.youtube.com for their students, but wants some of the YouTube channels allowed which are helpful for students.

Ganpat University's challenges are:

All Students should not be allowed to access www.youtube.com. If any student tries to access YouTube, then he/she should get a blocked template.

Only a few of the specified YouTube channels and their playlists should be allowed. This YouTube channel contains educational and knowledge-sharing videos.

## Solution

You can achieve this by creating a policy in the Request Profiles Section and binding it with policies in the Access Profiles Section.

## Prerequisites

HTTPS Inspection should be enabled in SafeSquid. If not enabled, you can check our document - [How to enable HTTPS Inspection.](/docs/07-SSL%20Inspection/Setup%20SSL%20Inspection.md)

You need the YouTube **Channel-ID** and **List-ID** of the playlist you want to allow. You have to extract the Channel-ID and List-ID of the playlist from the YouTube URL before creating rules in SafeSquid.

## Channel-ID and List-ID Extraction

### Extract Channel-ID from YouTube Channel

1. Open the YouTube channel you want to Allow. Here we have taken CBT Nuggets Channel as an example.

Here you will get Channel-ID from the referrer URL. **Channel-ID** is the preceding portion of the URL after the **'channel/'** part. Save this part on a notepad for reference.

CBT Nuggets Channel URL: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClIFqsmxnwVNNlsvjH1D1Aw

**Channel-ID: UClIFqsmxnwVNNlsvjH1D1Aw**

Select any playlist of this Channel and click on **PLAY ALL** link on the page as shown below. Here we have selected playlist **CBT Nuggets Webinars**.

## Extract List-ID from the YouTube Channel

2. You can extract List-ID from the selected playlist.

**List-ID** is the preceding portion of the URL after the **'&list='** part. Save this part on a notepad for reference.

In our case we have taken playlist **CBT Nuggets Webinars** and its URL is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcB0j6uBJCA&list=PLQVJk9oC5JKo_bMWae3xsavpPMKAzIeGb

Extracted **List-ID: PLQVJk9oC5JKo_bMWae3xsavpPMKAzIeGb**

![Extract List-ID from YouTube Channel to Allow Specific YouTube Channel and its Playlist](/img/How_To/Allow_Specific_YouTube_Channel_and_its_Playlist/image2.webp)

You can check any videos from the playlist. You will observe every Video in the playlist contains the same List-ID.

URL for next video in CBT Nuggets Webinars playlist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q802E2jsByI&list=PLQVJk9oC5JKo_bMWae3xsavpPMKAzIeGb&index=2

**List-ID: PLQVJk9oC5JKo_bMWae3xsavpPMKAzIeGb**

## Test the Scenario

Now try to open videos other than the CBT Nuggets Webinars playlist of the YouTube Channel CBT Nuggets.

All the other videos will be blocked and the below template will be shown.

![Test policy that Allow Specific YouTube Channel and its Playlist](/img/How_To/Allow_Specific_YouTube_Channel_and_its_Playlist/image21.webp)

You can check the videos from the CBT Nuggets Webinars playlist of the CBT Nuggets channel. Only these videos will be allowed.

**Note:**

**This configuration will work only for videos sourced from the channel page and not from the feeds links or YouTube Videos embedded in website.**

**To allow all the videos of any specific YouTube Channel you have to insert List-ID's (of every playlist in that channel) and file part (of each individual unlisted video) of the URL in the File field of the Request Types Section.**
