# URL Redirection

URL redirection lets SafeSquid send users to a different URL than the one requested. Use it to enforce safe search, steer traffic for compliance, or redirect specific sites to an alternative destination.

## Documents in this section

### [Enforce SafeSearch](SafeSearch.md)
Search engines return explicit content when SafeSearch is not enforced. SafeSquid appends SafeSearch parameters to Google, Yahoo, and Bing queries so users cannot disable filtering. Enable SafeSearch policies for consistent content filtering across search traffic.

### [Redirect One Website to Another](01-Redirect_One_Website_to_Another.md)
Organizations need to send traffic from one URL to another for branding, blocking, or compliance. This document covers enabling the Redirect section, creating redirection policies in Real Time Content Security, and verifying redirects in Native logs. Use it to configure and validate URL-to-URL redirection.
