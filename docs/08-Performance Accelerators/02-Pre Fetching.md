## Overview
The Prefetching feature can be used as an 'internet accelerator'. It allows virtually any file referenced in HTML to be pre-fetched, not just images, and cached.

Prefetching is a good way to improve retrieval time. It reduces resource retrievals and improves retrieval time. The target range is wider than that of both, mirroring and caching.
