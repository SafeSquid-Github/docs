# SafeSquid Customisation Overview

## Tailored Enterprise Web Gateway Experience

SafeSquid customisation enables organizations to tailor proxy behavior to specific operational requirements and user experience expectations. Customisation spans two critical areas: visual presentation through custom templates and operational behavior through startup parameters. These capabilities allow enterprises to maintain corporate identity, optimize performance, and configure advanced deployment scenarios while ensuring seamless integration with existing infrastructure.

## Personalize User Experience Through Templates

Custom templates transform generic proxy responses into branded, informative experiences that align with organizational communication standards and user expectations.

### [Custom Templates](01-Custom%20Templates.md)
Organizations face user confusion when blocked content displays generic English error messages without branding or clear escalation procedures. Custom templates enable organizations to display branded error pages in any language with company logos, help desk contacts, and clear policy explanations. This approach enhances user awareness, reduces support tickets through clear messaging, and maintains corporate identity across all proxy interactions. Create HTML, image, or executable template files and configure them in SafeSquid's Templates section for specific blocking scenarios.

## Optimize SafeSquid Operational Behavior

Startup parameters provide granular control over SafeSquid's core operational characteristics, enabling organizations to optimize proxy performance for specific hardware, network topology, and traffic patterns.

### [Startup Parameters](02-Startup%20Parameters.md)
Default SafeSquid configurations may not match enterprise-specific requirements for threading, memory allocation, logging verbosity, cluster synchronization, or network socket tuning. Startup parameters provide granular control over SafeSquid's core operational characteristics including listening interfaces, thread management, buffer sizes, and master-slave configurations. Organizations can optimize proxy performance for their specific hardware, network topology, and traffic patterns while enabling advanced deployment scenarios like clustering and remote logging. Configure startup.ini parameters through SafeSquid's interface or manually edit configuration files to tune the proxy for optimal enterprise performance.
