# Header Re-Write



## Header filter behavior and scope

SafeSquid modifies HTTP header messages exchanged between clients (e.g. web browsers) and the requested web service. Administrators can add, delete, or modify header directives.

The request and response headers are processed by this section before they are processed by the facility to rewrite headers in the Content Re-Write section.

Header filter has 4 sub-sections: Global, Allow, Deny, and Insert.

The processing of a request or a response, by this section is bypassed if the Global sub-section is set to False, and the policies in Allow / Deny / Insert thus become muted.

The policies in the Insert section are processed after the policies in the Allow / Deny lists.

Setting the Default Policy to Allow in the Global Sub-Section, permits all HTTP headers to be exchanged unless there is a policy directive in the Deny List to prevent a header from being exchanged.

Similarly setting the Default policy to Deny shall block all non-mandatory HTTP headers from being exchanged, unless a policy in the Allow list, explicitly permits.



## Header filter configuration guides

### [Header Filter Configuration and Reference](/docs/Header_Obfuscation/Header_Filter_Configuration/)
Header allow/deny/insert behavior requires correct Global policy and rule configuration. The document covers the Global section, Allow and Deny rule parameters (Type, Value, Applies to, Profiles), and Insert rules for adding or modifying headers. Solution verification confirms policies apply as intended. Use the document to configure and validate header filtering.

## Next steps

Combine header filter with [Access Restriction](/docs/Access_Restriction/) and [Cookie Inspection](/docs/Cookie_Inspection/) for full request/response control.
