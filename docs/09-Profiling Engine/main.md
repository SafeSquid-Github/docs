# Profiling Engine in SafeSquid

The Profiling Engine in **SafeSquid** enables precise control over web traffic by defining rules based on user behavior, request attributes, and content context.

## Included Topics
- [Application Signatures](/docs/09-Profiling%20Engine/Application%20Signatures.md): Identify and manage traffic from specific applications.
- [Request Profiles](/docs/09-Profiling%20Engine/Request%20Profiles.md): Control traffic based on user-agent, MIME types, headers, etc.
- [Response Profiles](/docs/09-Profiling%20Engine/Response%20Profiles.md): Filter content based on server responses.
- [Time Profiles](/docs/09-Profiling%20Engine/Time%20Profiles.md): Apply rules based on access time windows.
- [Website Categorization](/docs/09-Profiling%20Engine/Time%20Profiles.md): Use category-based filtering for web traffic.

These profiles help enforce security, productivity, and compliance policies with granular precision.
