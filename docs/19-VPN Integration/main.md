Directly exposing a SafeSquid proxy server hosted in the cloud to office or remote users is insecure and exposes critical infrastructure to external threats. Establishing a dedicated, encrypted WireGuard VPN tunnel enables secure transport of traffic from enterprise networks or remote endpoints to the cloud environment without public exposure. This configuration isolates the proxy server, limits attack surfaces, and enforces zero-trust connectivity using SafeSquid's application-layer inspection and access control mechanisms.

## Setup Procedure

### 1. Deploy WireGuard on Cloud VPS

#### Download Setup Script

Fetch the automated installation script provided by SafeSquid to simplify WireGuard server setup.

```bash 
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SafeSquid-Github/wireguard/refs/heads/main/wireguard-setup.sh
```
#### Execute Script

Run the script to initiate the WireGuard server configuration.

```bash 
bash wireguard-setup.sh --install
```
**During execution, provide:**

-   Public IP: 203.0.113.10
-   Port: 51820
-   VPN Subnet: 10.66.66.0/24
-   Peer Name: Client1

**Outputs:**

-   Server config: **/etc/wireguard/wg0.conf**
-   Client config: **/etc/wireguard/wg0-client-client1.conf**

### 2. Install WireGuard on the Office Endpoint

Install WireGuard on the office client to enable VPN connectivity.

```bash 
apt update
```
```bash 
apt install wireguard -y
```
This provides the necessary tools: wg for tunnel management and wg-quick for service control.

### 3. Configure Office Endpoint

#### Retrieve Client Configuration from Server

Display the client configuration generated by the cloud-side script.

```bash 
cat /etc/wireguard/wg0-client-client1.conf
```
Copy the output.

#### Save Configuration Locally

Create the required directory and apply the configuration on the office client.

```bash 
mkdir -p /etc/wireguard
```
```bash 
vim /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf
```
Paste the copied output from the previous step and save the file.

### 4. Set Peer Routing Rules

#### On Cloud VPS

Modify the peer section in wg0.conf to allow routing to the office subnet and the client's tunnel IP.

**AllowedIPs = 10.66.66.2/32,10.200.2.0/24**

-   10.66.66.2/32: IP assigned to Client1
-   10.200.2.0/24: Entire office LAN behind Client1

#### On Office Client

Ensure routing towards the server and internal cloud subnet.

**AllowedIPs = 10.66.66.1/32,10.0.0.0/24**

-   10.66.66.1/32: Server tunnel endpoint
-   10.0.0.0/24: Internal cloud LAN accessible via VPN

### 5. Restart and Enable Services

#### Cloud VPS

Restart the interface to apply changes and enable persistence at boot.

```bash 
systemctl restart wg-quick@wg0
```
```bash 
systemctl enable wg-quick@wg0
```
#### Office Client

Restart the VPN tunnel with updated config and ensure service autostarts.

```bash 
wg-quick down wg0 && wg-quick up wg0
```
```bash 
systemctl enable wg-quick@wg0
```
### 6. Enable IP Forwarding

Edit the system control file to enable IPv4 packet forwarding.

```bash 
vim /etc/sysctl.conf
```
Uncomment or append:

```bash 
net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1
```
Apply the new setting:

```bash 
sysctl -p
```
### 7. Configure Routing

#### Cloud VPS Route

Route traffic destined for the office LAN via the WireGuard server's internal IP.

```bash 
ip route add 10.200.2.0/24 via 10.0.0.100
```
This ensures cloud workloads can reach the office network securely via VPN.

#### Office Router Configuration

Direct cloud-bound traffic from office LAN through Client1 (WireGuard client).

```bash 
ip route add 10.0.0.0/24 via 10.200.2.100
```
Guarantees LAN devices access cloud services routed through the VPN tunnel.

### 8. Enforce One-Way Tunnel Security

#### Block Unsolicited Traffic from Cloud to Office

Insert a firewall rule to drop unsolicited packets targeting the office subnet from the tunnel.

```bash 
iptables -A FORWARD -i wg0 -d 10.200.2.0/24 -j DROP
```
#### Persist Firewall Rules Across Reboots

Install the persistence utility and save the current rule set.

```bash 
apt install iptables-persistent -y
```
```bash 
netfilter-persistent save
```
## Validate VPN Connectivity

### Cloud VPS Ping Tests

Confirm tunnel and office endpoint reachability.

```bash 
ping 10.66.66.2
```
```bash 
ping 10.200.2.100
```
### Office Client Ping Tests

Ensure reverse reachability to server and cloud LAN.

```bash 
ping 10.66.66.1
```
```bash
ping 10.0.0.100
```
### Tunnel Status Inspection

Display active peers and session statistics.

```bash 
wg show
```
## Post-Deployment Considerations

### 1. Multi-Client Deployment (Office & Remote Users)

If you plan to support **remote employees**, not just a single office, you must:

#### On the WireGuard Server:

-   Generate separate peer configurations for each user or location.

-   Assign **unique tunnel IPs** to each client (e.g., 10.66.66.3/32, 10.66.66.4/32, etc.).

-   Use a separate AllowedIPs per peer.

Example server config for two clients:
```bash 
[Peer]

Office LAN

PublicKey = OFFICE_PUBLIC_KEY

AllowedIPs = 10.66.66.2/32,10.200.2.0/24

[Peer]

Remote User1

PublicKey = REMOTE_USER1_KEY

AllowedIPs = 10.66.66.3/32
```
#### On the Remote User

-   Use AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0 if they want **all their traffic** routed through the VPN.
-   Or use 10.0.0.0/24 if they only need access to internal cloud resources.

### 2. Directory Server Integration

SafeSquid requires directory services (e.g., Active Directory) for identity-based policy enforcement. Ensure:

-   Proxy initiates LDAP/LDAPS requests from its WireGuard tunnel IP
-   Directory server accepts and routes responses to VPN subnet (e.g., 10.66.66.1)

This guarantees seamless identity resolution and policy mapping inside the VPN-secured cloud perimeter.

### 3. Proxy Cluster with Centralised Load Balancer

When deploying multiple SafeSquid instances as a cluster:

-   Place a central load balancer between the office VPN ingress and the proxy layer
-   The load balancer handles all incoming WireGuard traffic
-   Distributes requests to proxy nodes for inspection and filtering
-   Routes sanitized output to the internet

The architecture shown in below image maintains performance, simplifies scale-out, and centralizes VPN and external access controls.

### 4. Key Pair Management

Each peer device must independently generate cryptographic keys:

```bash
wg genkey | tee privatekey | wg pubkey > publickey
```

-   Only the public key is shared with the server.
-   The private key is stored securely on the client system.
-   Key rotation is recommended for long-term deployments.
