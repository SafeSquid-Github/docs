## Overview
Clam AntiVirus (ClamAV™), is an antivirus software toolkit for Windows and Unix-like operating systems. One of its main uses is with mail exchange servers as a server-side email virus scanner. Distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL), ClamAV is free software. Both ClamAV and its updates are made available free of charge.

SafeSquid SWG, both for Linux and Windows, has a ready-to-use, built-in client for ClamAV Daemon.

ClamAV can be used to scan all incoming content for viruses, worms, Trojans and other malware, at the gateway, before the content is delivered to the users.

Infected files detected by ClamAV, are blocked at the gateway level and prevented from entering into the network.

## Global
With this antivirus feature you can detect and block files containing viruses known to the ClamAV daemon scanner.
