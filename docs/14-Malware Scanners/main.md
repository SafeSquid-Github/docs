## Malware reaches systems via the web; multiple layers reduce risk

The main path for malware is the Internet and the web. Protecting endpoints is necessary.  The key pathway through which malware attacks the system is the Internet and its popular service, the Web.

There are numerous ways to protect and remove malware from endpoints. Not a single method is enough to ensure endpoints are secure. The more layers of defense, the harder for hackers to hack endpoints. SafeSquid provides three different features/sections to protect endpoints from various antivirus -

1. SvScan Antivirus
2. ClamAV Antivirus
3. ICAP Antivirus

## Required setup
To scan the viruses for HTTPS websites HTTPS Inspection should be enabled in SafeSquid. Check the document to configure HTTPS inspection -  [How to enable HTTPS Inspection](/docs/SSL%20Inspection/main)

## SvScan
SvScan is a built-in module in SafeSquid that protects the users against viruses, Trojans, malware and other threats.

SvScan is used for scanning both HTTP and HTTPS traffic.

## ClamAV antivirus

ClamAV antivirus is extra layer of security beside SvScan which adds virus protection. ClamAV is an open-source antivirus engine that is built to detect viruses, trojans, malware and other threats. It supports multiple file formats (documents, executables or archives), utilizes multi-thread scanner features. With this antivirus feature administrators can detect and block files containing viruses known to the ClamAV daemon scanner. Administrators can integrate a dedicated ClamAV server with SafeSquid here.

## ICAP antivirus
ICAP antivirus performs virus scanning, content modification, and blocking of inappropriate content. Administrators can integrate different ICAP servers with SafeSquid. SafeSquid integrates with ICAP (Internet Content Adaptation Protocol) based services such as:

### Dr. Web's ICAP based antivirus
In this scheme, a client interacts with an HTTP server through a proxy server. The proxy server is a client of the ICAP server (Dr. Web ICAP).

Dr. Web ICAP module is a client of Dr. Web Daemon. Dr. Web ICAP allows to perform virus scanning (using Dr. Web Daemon) of all HTTP traffic coming from the HTTP server and transmitted by the proxy server via the ICAP protocol. The given scheme does not allow FTP traffic scanning.

Note that HTTPS traffic is not scanned as it is encrypted and cannot be decrypted without the public key of the HTTPS server.

### Kaspersky Antivirus for Proxy Server
Kaspersky Antivirus provides basic protection for endpoints. Kaspersky delivers essential protection that helps defend PCs against the latest viruses, ransomware & more.

In includes antivirus file, software and website scan, anti-phishing, protection against ransomware, control over internet traffic, vulnerability search, etc.

### Symantec Scan Engine
Symantec Endpoint Protection is a security software suite that includes intrusion prevention, firewall, and anti-malware features. Symantec Scan Engine is a TCP/IP server and programming interface that enables third parties to incorporate support for Symantec content scanning technologies into their proprietary applications.

### Trend Micro IWSS
Trend Micro InterScan Web Security Suite stops Internet threats at the gateway. This software suite provides a complete solution that blocks spyware and malware attacks at the Internet gateway. It also prevents access to known malicious web sites and provides an option to clean infected end-user PCs.
