In this scheme, a client interacts with an HTTP server through a proxy server. The proxy server is a client of the ICAP server (Dr. Web ICAP).

Dr. Web ICAP module is a client of Dr. Web Daemon. Dr. Web ICAP allows to perform virus scanning (using Dr. Web Daemon) of all HTTP traffic coming from the HTTP server and transmitted by the proxy server via the ICAP protocol. The given scheme does not allow FTP traffic scanning.

Note that HTTPS traffic is not scanned as it is encrypted and cannot be decrypted without the public key of the HTTPS server.
