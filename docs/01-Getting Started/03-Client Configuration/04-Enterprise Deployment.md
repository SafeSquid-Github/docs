# Enterprise Deployment

## Problem Statement

Organizations need centralized proxy configuration management for large-scale deployments requiring automated policy distribution and consistent configuration across thousands of endpoints. Manual proxy configuration becomes impractical in enterprise environments with hundreds or thousands of endpoints requiring consistent security policies and centralized management capabilities. Enterprise deployment methods enable automated configuration distribution, policy enforcement, and centralized management while ensuring consistent security coverage across all organizational endpoints.

## Key Benefits

**Automated Deployment**: Enterprise deployment methods enable automated proxy configuration distribution across thousands of endpoints with minimal administrative overhead. This automation reduces deployment time, configuration errors, and maintenance requirements while ensuring consistent security policy enforcement.

**Centralized Management**: Enterprise deployment provides centralized configuration management with automated updates, rollback capabilities, and centralized monitoring across large-scale environments. This centralized approach enables rapid policy changes and consistent security enforcement across all endpoints.

**Scalable Administration**: Enterprise deployment methods scale efficiently to support large organizations with thousands of endpoints while maintaining administrative control and security policy consistency. This scalability ensures cost-effective security management as organizations grow.

## Prerequisites

**Client-Side Preparations**: Ensure enterprise infrastructure includes Active Directory domain controllers, Group Policy management tools, and configuration management systems. Verify network connectivity between management systems and client endpoints.

**SafeSquid-Side Setup**: Configure SafeSquid proxy servers with appropriate load balancing, failover capabilities, and centralized management interfaces. Ensure proxy services are accessible from all client networks.

**System Requirements**: Enterprise infrastructure must include Active Directory, Group Policy management capabilities, and configuration management tools. Client systems must be domain-joined and support enterprise management protocols.

## Call to Action

### Windows Enterprise Deployment

#### Group Policy Objects (GPO) Configuration

**Create Proxy Configuration GPO**:
1. Open Group Policy Management Console
2. Create new GPO: "SafeSquid Proxy Configuration"
3. Navigate to Computer Configuration → Policies → Administrative Templates → Windows Components → Internet Explorer
4. Configure "Use automatic configuration script"
5. Enter PAC file URL: `http://pac-server.company.com/proxy.pac`
6. Configure "Disable changing proxy settings" to prevent user modification
7. Link GPO to appropriate Organizational Units

**Registry-Based GPO Configuration**:
1. Navigate to Computer Configuration → Preferences → Windows Settings → Registry
2. Create registry preference items:
   - ProxyEnable: DWORD = 1
   - ProxyServer: String = "192.168.1.100:8080"
   - ProxyOverride: String = "*.local;*.company.com;127.0.0.1"
3. Configure registry path: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings
4. Apply GPO to target Organizational Units

#### Active Directory Integration

**Deploy PAC File via GPO**:
1. Create shared folder for PAC files: `\\domain.com\NETLOGON\PAC\`
2. Copy PAC file to shared location
3. Create GPO to configure PAC file URL
4. Configure PAC file permissions for domain users
5. Deploy GPO to target Organizational Units

**User-Based vs Computer-Based Policies**:
1. **Computer-Based**: Apply proxy settings to all users on specific computers
2. **User-Based**: Apply proxy settings to specific users regardless of computer
3. Configure appropriate policy scope based on organizational requirements

#### Advanced GPO Configuration

**Environment-Specific Configuration**:
1. Create separate GPOs for different environments:
   - Corporate Network GPO
   - Remote Access GPO
   - Guest Network GPO
2. Configure conditional proxy settings based on network location
3. Use WMI filters to apply policies based on system characteristics

**Security Configuration**:
1. Configure "Disable changing proxy settings" to prevent user modification
2. Enable "Disable Internet Options" to prevent proxy bypass
3. Configure "Disable changing connection settings" for additional security

### Linux Enterprise Deployment

#### Puppet Configuration Management

**Puppet Proxy Configuration**:
1. Create Puppet manifest for proxy configuration:
```puppet
class safesquid_proxy {
  file { '/etc/environment':
    ensure  => present,
    content => template('safesquid_proxy/environment.erb'),
  }
  
  file { '/etc/profile.d/proxy.sh':
    ensure  => present,
    content => template('safesquid_proxy/proxy.sh.erb'),
    mode    => '0644',
  }
}
```

2. Create template files for proxy configuration
3. Apply Puppet configuration to target nodes
4. Monitor configuration compliance and updates

#### Ansible Configuration Management

**Ansible Proxy Playbook**:
1. Create Ansible playbook for proxy configuration:
```yaml
---
- name: Configure SafeSquid Proxy
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Configure system proxy environment
      lineinfile:
        path: /etc/environment
        line: "{{ item }}"
      with_items:
        - "http_proxy=http://192.168.1.100:8080"
        - "https_proxy=http://192.168.1.100:8443"
        - "no_proxy=localhost,127.0.0.1,*.local"
      
    - name: Configure APT proxy
      lineinfile:
        path: /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/95proxies
        line: "{{ item }}"
      with_items:
        - "Acquire::http::Proxy \"http://192.168.1.100:8080\";"
        - "Acquire::https::Proxy \"http://192.168.1.100:8443\";"
```

2. Execute Ansible playbook on target systems
3. Verify configuration deployment and compliance

#### System-Wide Configuration Management

**Profile.d Scripts Deployment**:
1. Create centralized proxy configuration script
2. Deploy script to `/etc/profile.d/proxy.sh` on all systems
3. Configure script permissions and execution
4. Test script execution and proxy configuration

**Network Manager Configuration**:
1. Create Network Manager configuration templates
2. Deploy configuration via configuration management tools
3. Configure automatic proxy detection and configuration
4. Monitor configuration compliance across systems
