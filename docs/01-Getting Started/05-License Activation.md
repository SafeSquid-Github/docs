## Licensing Overview and Activation Purpose

SafeSquid requires valid licensing to enable full functionality and continuous availability. Two licensing options are available:
- **Free Licensing**: Always free; supports core functionality without time restriction.
- **Commercial Licensing**: Includes real-time threat intelligence updates, 365-day disaster recovery and backup, and email-based support.

License activation is completed after installation and is essential for activating subscription-based features and ensuring platform synchronisation.

Activating multiple SafeSquid instances using the same activation key enables synchronisation of SSL certificates and configuration files across nodes.

## Readiness Checklist

### Client-Side Preparations

- Ensure the SafeSquid server has unrestricted outbound Internet access.
- Allow traffic through the firewall to the following endpoints and ports:

- Validate DNS resolution and establish successful HTTPS connections to each host.

### SafeSquid-Side Setup

- Install and configure the SafeSquid service on the target system.

## Activation Procedure

### Upload the Activation key 

First, configure browsers or network clients to route HTTP/HTTPS traffic through the SafeSquid proxy.

## **Troubleshooting Activation Failures**

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="Case 1" label="Case 1" default>
    **Case 1: Activation Key Not Detected By [http://safesquid.cfg/](http://safesquid.cfg/)**

    **Symptoms:** After uploading the activation key, the SafeSquid UI displays "Failed to set Subscription details."

    **Root Cause:** The activation key file is either missing or improperly named.

    **Resolution:**

    1. Verify the presence of the activation key file:

    ```bash
    ls -lrt /usr/local/safesquid/security/
    ```

    Ensure a file named activation\_key exists.

    2. If absent or misnamed, re-upload the correct activation key file.

    3. Restart the SafeSquid service:

    ```bash
    /etc/init.d/safesquid stop
    ```

    ```bash
    /etc/init.d/safesquid start
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="Case 2" label="Case 2" default>
    **Case 2: Subscription Server Unreachable**

    **Symptoms:** Post activation key upload, the browser shows "proxy server refusing connections."

    **Root Cause:** SafeSquid cannot connect to the subscription server due to network issues.

    **Resolution:**

    1. Test connectivity to the subscription server:

    ```bash
    ping swgupdates2.safesquid.net
    ```

    ```bash
    nslookup swgupdates2.safesquid.net
    ```

    Ensure the server responds and DNS resolution is successful.

    2. If connectivity fails, check firewall settings and network configurations to allow access to the required hosts and ports.

    3. After resolving network issues, restart the SafeSquid service:

    ```bash
    /etc/init.d/safesquid start
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="Case 3" label="Case 3" default>
    **Case 3: Improper Service Restart**

    **Symptoms:**

    - Even after uploading the activation key, subscription details remain unset.

    - The browser indicates the proxy server is refusing connections.

    **Root Cause:** SafeSquid service was not restarted correctly after activation key upload.

    **Resolution:**

    1. Ensure the monit service is configured properly to manage SafeSquid.

    2. If monit is not set up, manually restart the SafeSquid service:

    ```bash
    /etc/init.d/safesquid stop**
    ```

    ```bash
    /etc/init.d/safesquid start**
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
