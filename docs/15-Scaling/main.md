## Cluster your proxy servers

By linking multiple Proxy nodes in a load-balanced or failover cluster, you can enhance performance and reliability. SafeSquid supports both active-active and active-standby modes, catering to different operational requirements. Instances activated with the same key will have consistent policy replication and private web category synchronisation.
