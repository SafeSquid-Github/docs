# Network Signature

Maps client IP addresses or ranges to user-groups so access restriction rules and reporting apply by network segment. No user login required; policy is enforced by source IP or subnet. Use when user identity is unavailable (device-only access, legacy apps, shared kiosks).

:::tip Rule Evaluation Order
SafeSquid evaluates Network Signature rules (Allow List) **top to bottom** and applies the **first matching rule**. Place specific IP rules above broader ranges to ensure correct policy application. See [Rule Order Matters](#troubleshooting) below for details.
:::

## When to use Network Signature

| Use Network Signature When | Use User Authentication Instead |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------|
| IoT devices, printers, shared kiosks | User workstations with logins |
| Legacy apps without proxy auth support | Modern apps with credential prompts |
| Policy by location/VLAN/segment | Policy by individual user |
| Device-level accountability acceptable | User-level attribution required (SOC 2, PCI DSS) |

:::info Prerequisites
- SafeSquid deployed and operational
- Admin access to [Configuration Portal](/docs/SafeSquid_SWG/Configuration_Portal/)
- Known client IP addresses or subnets (static or predictable ranges)
:::

:::caution Compliance Consideration
Network Signature attributes traffic to IP/subnet and group, **not to a named user**. Where regulations require user-level attribution (e.g., PCI DSS, HIPAA), combine with user authentication or document the scope of IP-only policies for auditors.

## Configure IP-based user-groups

1. **Access SafeSquid Configuration**  
   Open the [Configuration Portal](/docs/SafeSquid_SWG/Configuration_Portal/) and click **Configure**.

   ![SafeSquid Configure page](/img/How_To/IP_based_authentication/image1.webp)

2. **Navigate to Access Restrictions**  
   **Application Setup** → **Access Restrictions** → **Allow List**

   ![Access Restrictions section](/img/How_To/IP_based_authentication/image2.webp)
   ![Allow List tab](/img/How_To/IP_based_authentication/image3.webp)

3. **Create New Policy**  
   Click **Add New**.

   ![Add New button](/img/How_To/IP_based_authentication/image4.webp)

4. **Define IP Range**  
   Enter the IP address or range in the **IP Address** field.
   
   **Supported formats:**
   - Single IP: `192.168.1.50`
   - Multiple IPs: `192.168.1.50, 192.168.1.51, 192.168.1.52`
   - IP range: `192.168.1.50-192.168.1.100`
   - CIDR notation: `192.168.1.0/24`

   ![IP Address field](/img/How_To/IP_based_authentication/image5.webp)

5. **Assign User-Group**  
   In **Add to User-Groups**, specify a unique group name (e.g., `FINANCE_DEVICES`, `GUEST_KIOSKS`, `IOT_SENSORS`).

   ![User-Groups field](/img/How_To/IP_based_authentication/image6.webp)

6. **Save Policy**  
   Click the checkmark to save.

:::tip Optional: Combine with Authentication
Set **PAM Authentication** to **TRUE** or add **Username/Password** if you want that IP range to *also* require user login. This allows "IP range + user authentication" for specific segments.
:::

## Example: Segmented network policies

| Segment | IP Range | User-Group | Authentication | Policy Goal |
|---------|----------|------------|----------------|-------------|
| Finance workstations | 192.168.10.0/24 | FINANCE | PAM required | User-level + department policy |
| Guest kiosks | 192.168.20.10-20 | GUEST_KIOSKS | None | Restricted browsing, no login |
| IoT devices | 192.168.30.0/24 | IOT_DEVICES | None | Update servers only |
| Executive floor | 192.168.5.0/24 | EXECUTIVES | AD/LDAP required | Premium access + audit |

## Verification

1. **Test from Client**  
   Send traffic through the proxy from a client in the configured IP range. The client is assigned the configured user-group and matching access rules apply.

2. **Check Interface**  
   **Access Restrictions** → **Allow List** shows the rule with IP range and user-group

3. **Review Logs**  
   ```bash
   tail -f /var/log/safesquid/identity.log
   ```
   Or **Reports** → **Detailed Logs**  
   Logs show client IP and assigned user-group

4. **Confirm Policy Application**  
   Access a restricted site from the client; confirm the group-specific policy is enforced (allowed/blocked as configured)

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| Wrong policy applied | Client IP not in range or rule order issue | Verify client IP is within the configured range; check rule order in Allow List (more specific rules should be above broader ones) |
| No group assigned | IP mismatch or typo in range | Confirm IP field syntax; test from a known IP in the range |
| Unexpected auth prompt | Rule has PAM or credentials set | For IP-only policy (no user login), ensure PAM is set to **FALSE** and username/password fields are empty |
| Overlapping ranges | Multiple rules match same IP | Consolidate rules or use more specific ranges; SafeSquid uses first matching rule |

:::tip Rule Order Matters
SafeSquid evaluates Allow List rules **top to bottom**. Place narrow, specific IP rules above broad ones:
1. 192.168.10.50 (single executive IP with premium access)
2. 192.168.10.0/24 (department subnet with standard access)
3. 0.0.0.0/0 (default policy for all others)

## Advanced: Dynamic IP assignment

For environments with DHCP where client IPs change:

1. **DHCP reservations:** Assign static IPs via DHCP for critical devices
2. **VLAN-based ranges:** Use predictable ranges per VLAN; map VLAN subnets to user-groups
3. **Combine with MAC-based DHCP:** Tie MAC addresses to IP reservations, then use Network Signature on those IPs
4. **Upgrade to user auth:** For dynamic endpoints (laptops, mobile), use [Directory Services](/docs/Authentication/Directory_Services/main/) instead

## Next steps

- **Add user authentication:** Combine Network Signature with [Directory Services](/docs/Authentication/Directory_Services/main/) or [BASIC](/docs/Authentication/BASIC/) for user-aware policies
- **Refine access rules:** Use [Access Restriction](/docs/Access_Restriction/) to define what each user-group can access
- **Enable SSL Inspection:** Configure [SSL Inspection](/docs/SSL_Inspection/) to inspect HTTPS traffic from IP-based groups
- **Report by group:** Use SafeSquid reports to analyze bandwidth and activity per user-group
