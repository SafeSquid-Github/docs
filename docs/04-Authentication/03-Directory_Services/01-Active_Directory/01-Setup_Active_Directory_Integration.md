# Setup Active Directory Integration

Establish a connection between SafeSquid and Active Directory (AD) to synchronize user and group entities. This is the foundational step for both Simple and SSO authentication.

:::info Prerequisites
- SafeSquid installed and operational.
- Windows Server with Active Directory installed and reachable from the SafeSquid server.
- [LDAP Admin](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ldapadmin/) installed (optional, used for verifying AD structure).
- A domain account with read permissions to the directory (Administrator or a dedicated service account).
:::

## 1. Verify Active Directory structure

Before configuring SafeSquid, ensure your users and groups are organized in AD. Use **Active Directory Users and Computers** on your Windows Server.

:::tip Note the Base DN
Your Base DN usually follows your domain name. Example: `safesquid.test` → `DC=safesquid,DC=test`.
:::

## 2. Link LDAP Admin with AD (Optional Verification)

Use LDAP Admin to test connectivity and find the correct DNs (Distinguished Names) for your configuration.

1. **New Connection:** Enter the AD Host IP and your credentials.
2. **Test Connection:** Click **Test connection** to verify connectivity before proceeding to SafeSquid.
3. **Fetch DNs:** If the tree is empty, right-click the connection → **Properties** → **Fetch DNs**.

## 3. Integrate LDAP with SafeSquid

1. **Access SafeSquid Interface:** Open the [Configuration Portal](/docs/SafeSquid_SWG/Configuration_Portal/) and click **Configure**.
2. **Navigate to LDAP Integration:** **Application Setup** → **Integrate LDAP**. Click the **+** (Add new) icon.
3. **Configure Connection Details:**
   - **LDAP Server FQDN / IP:** Enter your AD server details.
   - **Bind DN:** Enter the service account username (e.g., `Administrator@safesquid.test`).
   - **Password:** Click the arrow to enter and confirm the password.
   - **Base DN:** Enter your directory base (e.g., `DC=safesquid,DC=test`).
   - **LDAP Domain:** Enter your AD domain (e.g., `safesquid.test`).

4. **Save Policy:** Click the checkmark to save.

## Verification

| Step | Action | Expected Result |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| **Check Entities** | Go to **LDAP Entities** in the SafeSquid interface. | You should see a list of users and groups fetched from AD. |
| **Log Review** | Run `tail -f /var/log/safesquid/safesquid.log` | Look for "LDAP bind successful" or "fetched X entries" messages. |
| **Test Rule** | Create an access rule with an AD group in **LDAP Profiles**. | The rule should correctly identify members of that group. |

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| No LDAP entries fetched | Incorrect Base DN or Bind DN | Verify DNs using LDAP Admin; ensure the Bind DN is in UPN format (`user@domain.com`). |
| Authentication failed | Wrong password or account locked | Re-enter the password in the encrypted password field; check AD for account lockouts. |
| Connection timeout | Network or firewall block | Ensure port 389 (LDAP) or 636 (LDAPS) is open from SafeSquid to AD. |
| Empty LDAP Entries | Permissions issue | Ensure the bind account has read permissions for the target OUs/Containers. |
