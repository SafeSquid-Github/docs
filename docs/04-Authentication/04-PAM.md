## Overview

SafeSquid supports PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) for flexible system-level authentication integration. This page will cover configuring PAM as an authentication method in SafeSquid and linking to the system PAM stack. For other auth methods, see [Authentication](../main.md) and [Directory Services](03-Directory%20Services/main.md).
