## [Categorise Websites](https://help.safesquid.com/portal/en/kb/articles/categorize-websites)

To efficiently manage access to websites based on their content category, SafeSquid has a dynamic web categorisation engine. Real-time updates to SafeSquid's web categorisation database ensure the accurate classification of more than a million websites into over a hundred categories. In addition to this, advanced heuristic algorithms categorize unknown websites in real-time, based on URL, content, functionality, target audience, thematic focus, and web traffic behavioural patterns.

Furthermore, [custom categorisation](https://help.safesquid.com/portal/en/kb/articles/manage-custom-web-site-categorization) empowers security administrators with the ability to manually classify
websites into [private categories](https://help.safesquid.com/portal/en/kb/articles/create-and-manage-your-private-categories).
Use the custom categories to [allow](https://help.safesquid.com/portal/en/kb/articles/allow-specific-website-through-safesquid) or [block](https://help.safesquid.com/portal/en/kb/articles/block-specific-website-through-safesquid) websites through SafeSquid. Wildcards can be used to categorise domain variants under the same category.

## [Control internet access based on time](https://help.safesquid.com/portal/en/kb/articles/time-profiler)

SafeSquid offers customizable scheduling options for security policies, allowing temporal control over web traffic. Thus, you may allow access to specific websites based on the time of day, like social media during lunch hours.
