# Policy Management Console

The Policy Management Console (Configuration Portal) is the SafeSquid web interface for defining, simulating, and enforcing access control, URL filtering, SSL inspection, and DLP policies. Administrators use it to configure restriction profiles, real-time content security, authentication, and operational settings.

Access the interface from a browser using the SafeSquid server URL and port. Configure policies under **Configure** in the top-right; use the sidebar to navigate Real Time Content Security, Restriction Profiles, Authentication, and related sections. For step-by-step access and first-time setup, see [Getting Started](../01-Getting_Started/main.md) and [Connect Your Client](../01-Getting_Started/05-Connect_Your_Client/main.md).
