# Self-Service Portal

# Manage activation key, certificates, and cloud features in one place

The Self-Service Portal is a cloud-based interface for properties tied to the activation key: custom web categorization, SSL certificates, subscription details, VPN clients, and DLP signatures. Use it to keep activation keys, categorization, and SSL/DLP policies consistent across all SafeSquid installations. Access the portal with registered credentials to manage Custom Web Categorization, VPN, Configuration Backup, subscription, and certificate generation.
