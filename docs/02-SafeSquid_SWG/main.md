# SafeSquid SWG Architecture and Components

SafeSquid Secure Web Gateway (SWG) is a purpose-built HTTP proxy for application-layer security. It intercepts HTTP/HTTPS traffic, inspects Layer 7 content, and enforces access control, URL filtering, SSL inspection, and data leakage prevention.

This section covers the SWG architecture, components, and supporting services.

## Core Components

### [Configuration Portal](/docs/SafeSquid_SWG/Configuration_Portal/)

The web-based administrative interface for defining and managing proxy policies. Configure access restriction, SSL inspection, authentication, DLP, and operational settings through a centralized console.

**Access:** `http://safesquid.cfg/` (special hostname resolved by SafeSquid's DNS when your client uses the proxy) or `https://SERVER-IP:8443/` (direct access)

---

### [Application Ecosystem](/docs/SafeSquid_SWG/Application_Ecosystem/)

Overview of how SafeSquid components work together: proxy cluster, policy console, self-service portal, reporting, DNS security, and supporting services. Understanding the ecosystem helps with deployment planning and integration.

**Use for:** Architecture planning, understanding component relationships

---

### [SafeSquid Proxy Cluster](/docs/SafeSquid_SWG/SafeSquid_Proxy_Cluster/)

The central enforcement layer for HTTP/HTTPS traffic. Multiple proxy nodes can be deployed for high availability and load balancing with centralized policy management.

**Details:** [Proxy Clustering](/docs/Proxy_Clustering/main/)

---

### [Self-Service Portal](/docs/SafeSquid_SWG/Self-Service_Portal/)

Cloud-based portal for activation keys, license management, and SSL certificate generation. Reduces dependency on support for routine licensing and certificate tasks.

**Access:** [https://key.safesquid.com](https://key.safesquid.com)

---

### [Reporting Service](/docs/SafeSquid_SWG/Reporting_Service/)

Centralized log aggregation, dashboards, and forensic logging. Provides visibility into traffic patterns, policy enforcement, and compliance evidence.

**Use for:** Audit trails, usage analytics, incident investigation

---

### [Integrated DNS Security](/docs/SafeSquid_SWG/Integrated_DNS_Security/)

Policy-aware DNS resolution with DNSBL integration. Blocks malicious domains and mitigates DNS tunneling attacks.

**Details:** [DNS Security](/docs/DNS_Security/main/)

---

### [Supporting Services](/docs/SafeSquid_SWG/Supporting_Services/main/)

Operational services that ensure reliability and performance:

- **[Monit](/docs/SafeSquid_SWG/Supporting_Services/Monit/)** — Process monitoring and auto-restart
- **[BIND](/docs/SafeSquid_SWG/Supporting_Services/Bind/)** — Local DNS resolver for performance
- **[NTP](/docs/SafeSquid_SWG/Supporting_Services/NTP/)** — Time synchronization for SSO and TLS

**Critical for production:** Monit prevents service downtime; BIND improves DNS performance; NTP ensures authentication works correctly.

## Next Steps

1. **[Getting Started](/docs/Getting_Started/main/)** — Install and activate SafeSquid if you haven't already
2. **[SSL Inspection](/docs/SSL_Inspection/main/)** — Enable HTTPS decryption for policy enforcement
3. **[Authentication](/docs/Authentication/main/)** — Integrate with Active Directory or LDAP
4. **[Access Restriction](/docs/Access_Restriction/main/)** — Configure URL filtering and content policies
