## [Integrate with Web Cache Communication Protocol (WCCP)](https://help.safesquid.com/portal/en/kb/articles/transparent-redirection-with-safesquid-and-wccp)

For WCCP-enabled routers, SafeSquid can be configured to participate in transparent redirection.

## Prioritise mission-critical traffic

Mission-critical applications and services are vital for business continuity. By prioritizing mission-critical traffic, the applications get the necessary bandwidth and low latency to perform optimally.

### Segregate network channels for an application

Provisioning dedicated pathways for mission-critical applications reduces the risk of network congestion. Additionally, the implementation of QoS policies ensures that high-priority traffic gets the required resources and treatment.

### [Manage Bandwidth](https://help.safesquid.com/portal/en/kb/articles/do-bandwidth-management-with-limits)

In the event of a network disruption or disaster, managing bandwidth ensures that essential services and applications continue to operate, supporting business continuity and disaster recovery efforts.

To avoid degraded user experience due to network congestion, efficient allocation of network resources is essential. With SafeSquid, you can [set boundaries on the size and volume of data transfers](https://help.safesquid.com/portal/en/kb/articles/do-bandwidth-management-with-limits).

## [Setup Captive Portal](https://help.safesquid.com/portal/en/kb/articles/enable-captive-portal-port-on-safesquid)

Captive portals are typically used by business centres, airports, hotel lobbies, coffee shops, and other venues that offer Wi-Fi hot spots for Internet users. To secure public or guest Wi-Fi networks, the Internet clients are redirected to a captive portal. Here, the users are requested to reveal their identity for web access. SafeSquid correlates the user identity with the client IP for applying the access policies.

## Multi-homing your network

Using multiple Internet Service Providers (ISPs) minimises the risk of downtime due to outages at the internet provider. [Splitting load between different ISPs](https://help.safesquid.com/portal/en/kb/articles/split-the-load-between-different-isps) allows you to manage bandwidth more effectively by leveraging the combined capacity of multiple ISPs.



## [Caching Specific websites](https://help.safesquid.com/portal/en/kb/articles/caching-specific-websites)

Content Caching leads to faster load times and reduced bandwidth usage at the cost of increased management complexity and potential staleness of cached content. SafeSquid offers a neat, efficient, and manageable solution to only store content from frequently accessed websites.

## [Prefetch Content](https://help.safesquid.com/portal/en/kb/articles/prefetch-embedded-images)

With the prefetching feature, virtually any file referenced in HTML can be pre-fetched, and cached, thus reducing resource retrievals and improving retrieval time. The Prefetching feature can be used as an 'internet accelerator'.
