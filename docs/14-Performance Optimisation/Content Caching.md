## Overview

Content Caching improves bandwidth efficiency. A page or file, when requested by a user, is served to the user and a copy of it is also maintained locally in the cache. So, when a request is made to fetch the same page or file, it is served with the local copy, instead of 'a fresh fetch'. SafeSquid has a very neat, efficient and manageable Content Caching system.
