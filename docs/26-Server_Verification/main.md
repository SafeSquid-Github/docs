## Certificate installation enables HTTPS inspection in IE and Chrome

SafeSquid SSL certificate installation in IE or Chrome enables HTTPS browsing. This guide covers SSL certificate installation for IE and Chrome browsers. Steps may vary depending on browser versions.

:::note
SafeSquid web security client users do not need to manually import certificates into Chrome or IE.
:::

For Firefox, certificates use a separate store; see [Configure HTTPS Inspection](/docs/SSL_Inspection/Configure_HTTPS_Inspection/#import-certificate-into-firefox) for import steps.

## Client certificate trust guides

### [Import Certificate into Chrome or Internet Explorer](/docs/Server_Verification/Import_Certificate_Chrome_IE/)
Clients must trust the SafeSquid Root CA for HTTPS inspection to work without certificate warnings. The document provides step-by-step import of the SafeSquid SSL certificate into Chrome or Internet Explorer via Trusted Root Certification Authorities. Certificate deployment completes client-side trust for IE and Chrome. Use this document to complete client-side certificate deployment.
